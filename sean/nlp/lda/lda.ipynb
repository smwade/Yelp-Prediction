       "[u'Mr Hoagie is an institution. Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.',\n",
       " u\"Excellent food. Superb customer service. I miss the mario machines they used to have, but it's still a great place steeped in tradition.\",\n",
       " u'Yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend. But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on. They win pennysaver awards ever years i see why.',\n",
       " u'PROS: Italian hoagie was delicious.  Friendly counter employee. The restaurant was clean and neat. \\n\\nCONS: The pizza was not good.  Pre-formed crust, NOT fresh dough.  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER.  \\n\\nI guess the name says it all.  Get the hoagie, pass on the pizza.',\n",
       " u'First the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there\\'s no competition. Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74\\n\\nSo I\\'m thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12\" hoagie these will be awesome. \\n\\nI was sadly mistaken. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn\\'t give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent. \\n\\nSo on to the hoagies, the Italian is general run of the mill. Minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce. You get more meat at subway. Nothing really special & NOT worthy of the $10 price tag. \\n\\nSecond, the steak hoagie, it is atrocious. \\nNo cheese?!?!? You have to add cheese for $1 so now the steak hoagie is $11. That has so little amounts of meat that I thought I was eating a lettuce & onion hoagie. I am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie, possibly the worst value of a hoagie I\\'ve ever eaten. \\nI\\'m not say eating at subway is any better, but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so. \\nCheck out pasquales down the road, better hoagie & price.',\n",
       " u'Normally, I do not do reviews of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad.  If I had not felt sucker punched and mugged after I left Mr. Hoagie, I would not be writing this bad review.  On my first and last trip there, I paid $24.59 for two whole hoagies.  \\n\\n1) The Italian (ordered because the woman (she) working there told me it was their most popular hoagie) I ordered with lettuce and onions (no tomato, italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie).  I had to pay $1 to add cheese to the hoagie.  Because I was traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away, I asked for the italian on the side.  She told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side.  I passed on that on principle.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved her money by declining the tomato.  I was not going to pay for the dressing on the side.  At this point, I am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble.  That pales in comparison to what happened next.  I opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slices of meat on this hoagie.  Ham, salami, and bologna.  Bologna!?!?!?!?    Who in the hell puts disgusting bologna on an Italian hoagie?  That disqualifies that hoagie as an Italian.  The red flags indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view.  One area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna, no ham and no salami.\\n\\n2)  The Steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce, tomato, onions, and dressing.  I ordered it without lettuce, tomato, onions, or dressing.  I asked for mayo on the side.  I had to pay for that so I declined.  Are you kidding me?  I just saved them money by passing on the lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, and dressing!  I paid $3 to add saut\\xe9ed mushrooms, onions, and cheese.  Here we go again.  Canned mushrooms that were not even cooked through (were still cold) and onions that were still crunchy/undercooked.  News flash:  you need to serve fresh mushrooms that have been saut\\xe9ed (canned mushrooms are another sign this place is in financial trouble).  I literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because I could not taste or see it.  The hoagie was 50% mushrooms, 30%onions, 10% cheese and 10% steak.\\n\\nI could have personally made 10 whole hoagies with substantial quality ingredients and toppings for the $24.59 I paid for these two whole hoagies.  I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants to support small businesses.  In this case, Never. Again.  (The hoagie bun was better than average.)  Wake up or you are going to lose your business.',\n",
       " u\"I like this place a lot. It's a good toasted hoagie.\\n\\nI actually don't like a my bun exploding with meat, but as a previous poster mentioned if you do maybe you wouldn't like this place.\\n\\nThe inside badly needs updated though. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly.\",\n",
       " u'All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The \"Wet Cajun\" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\\n\\nThe dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer\\'s dream!!  \"Pittsburgh Dad\" would love this place n\\'at!!',\n",
       " u\"We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night. We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon.\",\n",
       " u'Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.',\n",
       " u'Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. \\n\\nLooking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. \\n\\nGood grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer.',\n",
       " u\"Possibly the most overhyped establishment in Allegheny County. If you're not a regular, you will be ignored by those who're tending bar. Beer selection is okay, the prices are good and the service is terrible. I would go here, but only if it was someone else's idea.\",\n",
       " u\"Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).\",\n",
       " u\"Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be.\",\n",
       " u\"Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nIt's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \\n\\nThe guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \\n\\nA big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\\n\\nPrice for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again.\",\n",
       " u\"I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!\",\n",
       " u'This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak\\'s \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he\\'s usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I\\'m pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.',\n",
       " u\"Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u'This place should have a lot more reviews - but I\\'m glad it doesn\\'t, they don\\'t need to get any busier.\\n\\nIts been there ages, and looks it. If you\\'re all about ambiance, don\\'t bother. If you pretend you\\'re in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you\\'re happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \\n\\nThe food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.\\n\\n-Fish Sandwiich\\n-Salmon (huge and delicious)\\n-Flounder\\n-Shrimp a few ways (\"Norfolk\" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)\\n-Hawkins St Special\\n-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)\\n\\nThe prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I\\'m not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don\\'t want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.',\n",
       " u'This place was very good. I found out about Emil\\'s when watching a show called \"25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh\" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain\\'t a luxurious restaurant...it\\'s a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain\\'t in a great part of town, Rankin, but I\\'ve been in worse places!! Try this place.',\n",
       " u'Old school.....traditional \"mom \\'n pop\" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you\\'ll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it.',\n",
       " u\"Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback\\nack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty.\",\n",
       " u\"Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911.\",\n",
       " u'Good fish sandwich.',\n",
       " u\"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\\n\\nWell, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\\n\\nAnd yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nSo off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \\n\\nWe walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\\n\\nThis is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\\n\\nOh...but good food counts too. \\n\\nWe each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\\n\\nMy friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\\n\\nThe waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \\n\\nThey only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\\n\\nEmil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\\n\\nYou definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\\n\\nAddendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back.\",\n",
       " u\"From reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list a few years ago.  I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me one of the best fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked!  I've had at least 10 since then, but only during the Lent season.  I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  Try it without a bun also!  Either way you get 3 nice size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n cheese for my side.  The staff is always really friendly and service is prompt.  It's in a rough neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right across the street.  Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking up lunch orders.  Soon I plan to make a visit that's not a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.\",\n",
       " u\"Another divey place we have been going to for years. My dad's favorite, as he knows the original owners. Certain items on the menu are named after the kids. Huge portions, might have a bit of a wait some nights. Huge burgers, fish sandwiches, salads. Decent service.\",\n",
       " u\"Love my hometown favorites. Cannot beat their fish sandwiches (although I do miss the buns as opposed to the sliced bread...stop that). Always will support Emil's\\nOther favorites include Reuben, Hawkins Avenue sandwich, Chrissy Club.\",\n",
       " u\"Emil's is a great place to eat! The prices are VERY reasonable, the portions are HUGE and everything I have ever ordered has been tasty and well prepared. The people who work there are so friendly, as are the customers who eat there. Ample free parking makes it easy to go there. I didn't worry about the area- the police station is right across the street. Don't leave the Burgh without having (1) their fish sandwich, and (2) their Reuben. You will be glad you ate there!\",\n",
       " u\"I love everything about this place. The food is delicious (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love that there are no windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, real food and good people. Lots of places try to create this kind of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good food and good vibes.\\n\\nAlso, the food is really good. :)\",\n",
       " u\"I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  \\n\\nThe place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.\\n\\nThe place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.\\n\\nThe service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.\\n\\nOverall, if you consider yourself a true Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit of Pittsburgh is alive and hungry.  Please go.\",\n",
       " u'We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good food and friendly staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!',\n",
       " u\"We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends we were stopping off for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed the best Reuben,  fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us for stopping. She is a real asset to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken places where she had to hover  over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food. Don't forget the liver and onions.\",\n",
       " u\"Excellent fish sandwich, Wonderful Reuben Sandwich, even the stuffed cabbage tastes homemade.   Chrissy \\nIs a delightful hostess and makes you feel welcome.  Restaurant personnel are pleasant.   I really enjoy visiting Emils when I'm in town   My only regret is that they are closed Mondays.   Worth the trip\",\n",
       " u'I wouldnt say the best fish sandwich ive ever had...definitely a huge portion but rather bland and nothing special. Very nice people and good service but i would largely disagree with most of the reviews here. Atmosphere was quite drab, classic western pa corner bar but no windows, poorly lit, and overall fairly dismal.... Clientele seemed to be on deaths door, missing limbs and morbidly obese. Fries were frozen and under cooked. Meatballs were dry and bland as well. I had high hopes but left feeling disappointed, defeated, bloated and like i had swallowed the entire rustbelt in one bite...',\n",
       " u\"This is my fourth time but my first review. It never disappoints! Always home cooking, old school like grandma's house. Don't expect ambiance, but if you're hungry and want nice wait staff, (usually family) squeaky clean, great value and generous portions-way more than I can ever finish, Emil's is your place.\\n\\nTonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good! Very obviously home made. I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly cooked, which doesn't sound fancy, but I still couldn't finish. My husband had the chicken parm. Thursday is Italian night. It came with a huge salad, very fresh, an entire loaf of Italian bread, and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breasts. Added to that, a side helping of ziti. My husband enjoyed it very much, the chicken was perfectly cooked. I'm a sauce snob, Italian, allergic to with an aversion to green peppers. To me, there was just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid anything with red sauce at Emil's but that's just my quirk. I've had the stuffed cabbages there, the fried fish, Ruebens, burgers - all wonderful! Emil was and his family is of Serbian decent. Food is love. We love Emils!\",\n",
       " u\"I remember the old man 20 years ago eating a giant size hamburger used asked me questions I miss those days food there is spectacular the fish is to die at four if you never been there just put it on your schedule of your things to do and I promise you you won't be sorry.\",\n",
       " u\"Great food  & service every visit. They do so many things right there especially taking care of the customers.  I have always received a hello, a follow up on my food, a thank you and then a good bye.  Some many restaurants get away from these simple steps of service. I'm glad Emil's has not.\",\n",
       " u\"This is our second time here in two weeks.  We have always liked Emil's, but just haven't been out this way lately.  This is now going to change.  Last week we had the wonderful fish - it has always been good.  Last week we stopped on a Tuesday after golf.  The bartender recommended the special of the day - the Chicken Romano with garlic and olive oil pasta.  It was truly outstanding!  I can't wait to go back and have it again!  The homemade Tomato soup with Asiago cheese was delicious as well.  Thanks Chef Tony!\",\n",
       " u\"Chicken Romano (yes, again - it's that good). My husband had the Shrimp stuffed with crab - wow! Love, love! Thanks KK, great suggestions!\",\n",
       " u\"I like this course. It's always very well maintained. The carts are in excellent shape, all electric and all equipped with GPS. The greens fees are extremely reasonable and many of the holes are challenging, even if you are a better golfer. It truly has a grand view up and down the Mon, from the Triangle and the Cathedral of Learning to Braddock, the Edgar Thompson Works, Kennywood and beyond. Yet, when you go a few more feet on the cart path, you are in the woods, alone with the abundant wildlife. One caveat- bring an abundant supply of balls. If you golf like I do, one sleeve will not be enough!\",\n",
       " u'2nd time playing here. Was in the area for a bowling tournament so a group of us decided to come early and get a round of golf in. The course is hilly and challenging with readable and fairly flat greens. But, as the name suggests, what a Grand View of both the course as well as the surrounding areas. \\nCarts are in excellent shape and provide you with electronic scoring and course GPS.  The folks here take pride in their course and take very good care of it.',\n",
       " u\"Challenging but fun course! Bring plenty of extra balls, I am a novice and lost at least 5. Carts are in great condition and remind you to stay on the cart path (sometimes annoying when looking for balls but safety first) and guide you to the next hole. The pro was very nice and patient with our group as we had to delay teeing off for an hour due to parkway closures. Driving range is nothing to write home about but gets the job done for warming up. Beautiful views and lots of variety of length and layout of holes. I'll definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u\"This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!\\n \\nIt was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. \\n\\nThey have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.\\n\\nGoing back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.\\n\\nThe other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt.\",\n",
       " u\"A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \\n\\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\n\\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\n\\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.\",\n",
       " u\"Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home!\",\n",
       " u'Good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. \\n\\nDoesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol. \\n\\nTheir wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. \\nOffers a quick lunch.',\n",
       " u'What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.

       " u\"Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had.\",\n",
       " u\"Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well.\",\n",
       " u\"Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.\",\n",
       " u\"We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the Yelp reviews. I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. \\n\\nWe ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. \\n\\nAll 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\\n\\nI may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)\",\n",
       " u\"The bar is nice enough the servers are attentive enough the food is good enough. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd. It's kind of lost in the crowd.

       " u\"I went to Alexions with a co-worker/friend for lunch during lent.  First impression, it was small and packed.  This is apparently a very popular lunch stop.  They have a nice outdoor seating section, but it was closed due to the weather.  \\n\\nI opted for their Friday special a fish sandwich with cheese, hold the cheese.  I hate cheese on fish, in my mind it doesn't go well together.  It came with one side and chips.  I opted for cole slaw because that does go great with fish.  The chips were straight out of a bag.  I am not a chip fan, especially not one that Lay's delivered.  It would have been nice to have homemade chips.  The special was 10.50, so I was hoping it would be good.\\n\\nThe wait wasn't terrible for as busy as they were, but if you're on a strict time schedule for lunch I'd call ahead.  The food arrived in about 20 minutes.  My fish sandwich though nice size was a little small for the price, compared to other's that are cheaper.  The slaw was nice, good flavor but the fish was average.  I loaded it up with some tarter and cocktail sauce to help the flavor out.  It wasn't a bad sandwich just a tad small and mediocre for the price.  I would stop back to try something else another time and would love to grab a beer here, as they had a really decent selection, and the servers were also pleasant.\",\n",
       " u\"This place has a real neighborhood vibe to it, and offers a nice selection of brews along with a decent menu if you're here for a meal.

       " u'I got \\'new\\' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \"this time\". \\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!',\n",
       " u\"Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time.\",\n",
       " u\"Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \\nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry.

       " u\"Most random location for a mini golf course ever.  This is old school. It's built into the woods (spray yourself for bugs first) right off Forsythe Rd near Carnegie Park.  The candy hut is fun to spend your spare change.  They recently re-carpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that weren't there before.  It won't knock your socks off, but if you're local, give it a try!\",\n",
       " u\"This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par.\",\n",

       " u\"I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right!

       " u\"Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing.\",\n",
       " u'I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\\n\\nWhy two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I\\'ll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\\n\\nHe told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\\n\\nHere\\'s where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\\n\\nSo our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\\n\\nA month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \\n\\nI completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they\\'re waiting for the permit, but they\\'ll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\\n\\nFinally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they\\'re digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn\\'t informed! \\n\\nI was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nThen two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn\\'t need access to my house changes to they\\'re drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \\n\\nFinally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn\\'t cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn\\'t use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn\\'t it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn\\'t happen here.\\n\\nMy main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It\\'s not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\\n\\nEven though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone.',\n",
       " u'When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck. Once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time. I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall, they did a good job and I would use them in the future for all my deck necessities.',\n",
       " u\"Our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight. He was wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injuries. My girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for us immediately.  When we got there, I couldn't believe how friendly and caring they all were. We went into the exam room with doctor Tierney Kelley and a vet asst Sam. They were the best. So gentle and caring. They did not pressure us into any procedures that my cat did not need. They worked hard So we didn't have to leave him over night. This was by far the best veterinarian I have gone to in all my years as a pet owner. This has all become a racket for making money. Doctors don't care about the animals in 90% of the places you go, but Greetree animal clinic is not one of those places. I will be taking my other pets there from now on and recommend this place and Doctor Kelly to everyone I know. Thank you so much again if you read this. Doctors Kelley you're the best.\",\n",
       " u'Greentree Animal clinic is the absolute best!  We have had both Dr Mann and Dr. Reuther.  Both are very good, each in their own strengths.  I recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip.  Dr. Mann was very sensitive and caring to my feelings of loss.  He offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed.  He went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side.  Thank you for allowing me that experience, and for guiding me through the process.',\n",
       " u\"I cannot praise this place enough. I have worked as a vet tech in a previous job and have had experiences at numerous facilities here in Pittsburgh and Greentree Animal Clinic blows them all out of the water. Key things that you should note about this place:\\n* They do not over charge\\n* They only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet, not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way\\n* They are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays\\n* Everyone from the front desk to the techs, to the vets are kind, patient and understanding. No condescension or poor attitudes, just positive vibes all around. \\n* Dr Brown goes above and beyond any vet I've ever met. He has shown so much care, professionalism,  kindness and knowledge that I will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because I know they will be in good hands and his fellow vets (Dr Reuther, Dr Kelley, and Dr Mann)  are just as phenomenal. \\n\\nThankyou Greentree Animal Clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all Veterinary Care Facilities.\",\n",
       " u'I can;t believe this place has a high rating. I had a bichon, who was seen here since his puppyhood and who was dying. I called to make an appointment to have him put down because he was in great pain. The receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later, even though she could hear him crying out in pain. Anyway, he died in agony before his appointment. This was in 2010 and I have not taken my subsequent pets to the clinic.',\n",
       " u\"Three months ago I brought my 13 yr old golden retriever to this clinic for an ear problem. It was diagnosed and treated.  Shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like.  I watched her for a couple hours do this and then called the vet to see if maybe she was having an allergic reaction to the medicine they gave her.  She was very uncomfortable.  I asked if they though she needed to come back to the office.  The dr told me that it sounded like she was overheated and to put cold towels on her.  I told him that I didn't think that was the problem because she hadn't been out.  At this point they were open and would be for another hour.   Two hours later I was at a vet hospital with them telling me she is suffering from a heart problem and that they really couldn't do anything for her.  WHAT?!?!  So I found myself having to put her down.  Fast forward to now.  I have a 14 wk puppy that has blood in its stool. They have not seen her yet. I bring in a sample.  Wait 24 hrs.  They leave a message that it's positive and to call for an appt.  I call. She has to wait 4 days to be seen.  WHAT?!?!?   Obviously my pups are out of there for good!  Thanks Greentree for caring for my animals...  Absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets!!\",\n",

I took my present car back to the dealership the day after driving it off the lot to have them show me how to turn on my hazard signal, also, to show me how to release the parking brakes, and how to turn on the rear defoggers. Yes, the owners manual was in the glove box, but there was way too much reading involved, and I learn quicker by hands on training.\\n\\nAdvanced Auto is a God send for me, when I needed windshield wipers, the ones on the car sounded like a cow being skinned alive each time I turned them on. So, I didn't use them often, which isn't good in a driving rain storm. I walked in and went up to an associate and asked him where the wipers were. Not only did he get me the wipers, he saved me a ton of embarrassment by putting them on for me at no extra charge. I gave him a nice tip which he refused, but I insisted. I also picked up a nice leather steering wheel cover (proud to say I figured out how to put that on without a mechanic!) and a gas additive to clean out my fuel system. \\n\\nThis place has everything, and if you're not a gear head, they'll either show you how or do it for you.

       " u\"I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.\\n\\nWe chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:\\n\\nTea\\nPepsi\\nOpen-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy\\nBuffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese\\n\\nOur drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  \\n\\nI tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad.\",\n",

SO DELICIOUS!\\n\\nHowever, NOW there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  Fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.\\n\\nThe portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream.\",\n",
       " u\"Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \\n\\nService is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\\n\\nIm in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.

She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\\n\\nThe waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee\\xae Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.\\n\\nKings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again.\",\n",

       " u\"This place went from great to horrible. First visit was for a flat tire and recommended. Absolutely no problems. Now when I needed my car inspected in June, they put SNOW TIRES on my car. NOISY snow tires in the summer! I told them I didn't want these tires and they told me I would have to come back the next day and talk to the owner. When I went back the owner told me they weren't snow tires. The tires were called BLIZZARDS! I told him they are too noisy. He told me to come back another day. I tried and tried but he NEVER had the time. Very rude and once they get paid have no ethics.\",\n",
       " u'My wife recently went to buy 4 \"used\" tires to replace her balding tires. While there she also got an inspection. The person working only sold her 2 tires that were needed and said her other two were fine. She also had no way home so had to sit and wait for everything to be done. Since she was waiting they did the inspection right away. They had a chance to oversell her products and didn\\'t. I can\\'t think of a better way to promote a mechanic business than by not ripping off your customers because they don\\'t know better. Thank you for your great service and your honesty. The \"used\" tires are great. We just had a snow today and they did perfectly. The price couldn\\'t be beat either. $180 total for 2 tires installed, inspection and emissions.',\n",
       " u\"Unfortunately, I only have one complaint about this dry cleaners. It was well kept and clean inside. The man waiting on me (I'm guessing the owner) was very nice, both dropping off and picking up, even though I lost my ticket. Turn around time was OK for a cleaners that don't do cleaning on premises. What's my problem then? Price. My daughter's dress was $18 to clean. I think that's close to what I paid for it. My ladies shirts were $6/unit. Maybe I'm not calibrated on Pgh prices but this seems outrageous. My search continues for a neighborhood cleaners. BTW, they do men's tailoring there on-site and it looks like it might be a big part of their business. I would try them again for that (after I check costs!)\",\n",

They have offered $20 a shirt for the shirts they lost. Those shirts are worth at least $50 each, and I refuse to take under $30 for each.

My friend had a tuxedo custom made by Rossi's. \\n\\nI am extremely happy with the end results!\\n\\nI wanted a European cut on jackets and no break on the slacks; a nice tailored look. The suits look awesome. I'm going to go through my closet and take some of my older suits to be tailored (some of my older suits are a little looser fitting; I now like the more tailored European look). Juliano (the owner) will shorten the length of my jackets, take the sides in and shorten my slacks. They'll look brand new.\\n\\nAs for the price, I'm very happy.

       " u\"Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\\n\\nOn the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\\n\\nWell, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\\n\\nThe second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\\n\\nI was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\\n\\nWe hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\\n\\nThe mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \\n\\nAfter the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \\n\\nWell, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\\n\\nThank goodness for the basic salad bar.\\n\\nEven my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\\n\\nThe irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\\n\\nThird base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area.

       " u'This is a great little gem!  On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  A friend of mine who lived in the area recommended Rocky\\'s.  As I walked in the door I was pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special was the fish fry.  I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  The order was delivered to my table in no time.  The fish and sides were tasty and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cakes.  Well needless to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  Another good choice!  At the end of night the Penguins couldn\\'t pull off the win over the Rangers but I definitely have a new \"go to\" when I\\'m in town.  Another star could be added for a smoke free environment.

This place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return, even if your experience was less than stellar. Fancy it is not. Gourmet it is definitely not. Every item on the menu seems to come from a can, bag ,bucket or box. The wait staff is often clueless and changes like the wind. I have never had the same server twice. But the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home. Yes, the salad bar is very basic. Not every item is a fresh as it should be. The iced tea often takes on the taste of Lord knows what. However,  the fried fish dinner is one of the best I have had anywhere in Picksburg. Their meatloaf is terrific as are several of their hoagies. In a nutshell, this place has a lot of flaws. Like we all do. A few upgrades like a better wait staff, fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand, homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 stars. Rocky's is worth going to. You will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back. Decent food, decent price, good portions and an overall pleasant experience.\",\n",

       " u'Okay, let\\'s first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have \"dippy\" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a \"dippy\" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!!',\n",
       " u'I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did.',\n",
       " u\"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \\n\\nHere are the highlights:\\n\\n-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\\n-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\\n-Cash only\\n-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\\n-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\\n-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo\",\n",

       " u\"My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  \\n\\nHave had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!\\n\\nLunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.\\n\\nGets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.\\n\\nRemember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor.\",\n",

       " u\"Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive.\",\n",
       " u'Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel. \\n\\nReminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi. \\n\\nHave fun finding a table on the weekend :)',\n",

       " u'OK, what is with all of these \"CASH ONLY\" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \\n\\nLooking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can\\'t even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn\\'t leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\\n\\nMy first impression is \"Eh.\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \\n\\n\"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\"\\n\"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\"\\n\"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\"\\n\\nI\\'d rather go to a Denny\\'s and order the \"create your own Grand Slam!\"',\n",
       " u\"BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\\n\\nIt's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana.\",\n",
       " u'Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy!',\n",
       " u'Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast.',\n",
       " u'Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That\\'s because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I\\'ve ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\\n\\nI easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can\\'t imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \\n\\nWhen my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I\\'d barely started.  The sausage was great, just don\\'t ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \\n\\nIn case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\\n\\nA few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won\\'t feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You\\'ll be glad you did!',\n",
       " u\"Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\\n\\nWhat's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.\\n\\nOnly bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in.\",\n",
       " u\"Yum - freaking - me!\\n\\nAs the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:\\n\\n- Don't eat early in the week \\n- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave\\n\\n\\n I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.\\n\\nMy co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.\\n\\nFood - \\n\\nThe Mixed Grill comprises their homemade sausage, grilled onions, grilled peppers, potatoes, fried eggs.     \\n\\nPortion -\\n\\nThis should have been a man vs food episode.   I was not going to attempt to eat all the food.   It was really good.\\n\\nService - \\n\\nMy waitress looks as if she had been working there for years.   She was fast, friendly, and offered good advice.\\n\\nPrice - \\n\\nThe cost ranges $5 - 10.\\n\\n\\nI will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants.\",\n",
       " u'Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious.',\n",

       " u'I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \\n\\nThis place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a \\'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that\\'s fresh.\\n\\nWe want to return sometime for \"turkey day.\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to return.',\n",

       " u\"On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\\nWe arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\\nInside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\\nThe waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\\nAfter reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \\nHis bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\\nThe Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\\nEverything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\\nMy only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\\nIt usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\\nCoffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\\nWhile I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.\",\n",
       " u\"Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!\",\n",

       " u\"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).\",\n",
       " u'A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service.',\n",

       " u'Gab n Eat is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and always a treat.  We went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch. Vs breakfast debate. I saw another customers soup and knew i would have to try it. The soup was a  Lobster Bisque and it was amazing.....creamy deliciousness. I could have had a quart of it. Yum!  I ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill. (When at Gab n Eat. You have to order the 1/2 grill) I had mine with bacon. Bacon was crisp and delish. and M ordered the regular mixed grill. We also shared an order of potato pancakes. They even brought us 2 sides of applesauce and sour cream. The pancakes could have been a tiny bit crisper, but still very good.',\n",
       " u\"Really just OK. It was chaotic and no one alerted us to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter, she gave us a dirty look like we weren't welcome there. Eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order. The server was nice enough, but wasn't very quick with the coffee refills - I finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minutes. Food was ok, but not amazing. We got the mixed grill and a pancake, and both were solid but not outstanding. \\nNot a bad place to go, but we probably won't go out of our way to go here again, either.\",\n",
       " u\"Sadly, I have only been here twice, only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work. However, when I am in the area, this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast. Its almost like going back in time to where the old style local diners or Isaly's to get made to order diner style food. Love the eggs made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable prices. I only wish Gab & Eat would move to my neighborhood.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is divey but cute. The food is obviously not five-star, but it's a great place if you want to get a good, hearty breakfast. We went there for lunch and got burgers...oddly enough the server said that they don't sell French Fries on Sundays.....? So we had to settle for home fries. I thought it was a little weird at first, but damn, those home fries were good! I didn't even care after that. The coffee is great too!\\nIt's a unique little place. It's basically one long strip of a kitchen, then booths set up right beside it! They also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order. The coffee cups didn't match - they were all Christmas mugs lol - they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker, and they have little trivia boards on the wall just for fun. It's definitely a place of it's own kind. The prices are very reasonable, and I would definitely go back again.\",\n",

       " u\"We came here once before and remember it not being very good, but figured we'd give it another shot since it's pretty close to our home. It's still just OK. We didn't have to wait this time (Saturday morning at 10:30), but there was a wait throughout the time we were there. The menu is very basic- no specialty pancakes, waffles, or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette. There were no meal options, so if you want home fries or something, it's extra. The omelettes do include toast. (Great bread, btw!) We had to wait a while for our food, which was surprising because we've been to a lot of diners. My husband and I both got omelettes and agreed that the contents were not really cooked with the egg. It's almost like the egg was completely cooked and someone threw the cooked contents in there and just folded it over. As for my mushroom and cheese omelette, the cheese was lacking. My biggest peev about this place is that it's CASH ONLY. Perhaps I missed it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't noted anywhere on the menu or the front door. Thankfully, we had enough to cover our bill, but's not a good way to end the meal when you're scrambling and digging for change. There are a lot of good diners in the area, so I doubt we'll be going back.\",\n",

Finally 2 seats at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.\\n\\nSurprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill. Mine had sausage links and she decided on bacon. \\n\\nIt was a blast watching all the food being made right before our eyes. Giant club sandwiches, super thick pancakes, eggs eggs and more eggs.. it was a fun time. \\n\\nThe restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese.

It\\'s a seat your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what\\'s to complain about there?  My Date got the bagel sandwich and \"Hey Rayed\" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing and large enough that she now has lunch as well.

My waitress made sure I always had a fresh cup of hot tea since I was sitting near the entrance. It seemed like a long production line to wait for your order but it did not disappoint. When I got my half orders I was overwhelmed at the size!\\n\\nThe waffle was thick and fluffy and the home fries which bore a resemblance to hash browns were hot and greasy. Ketchup is on the counter as well as syrup. Yes they use real butter here since I could observe one of the chefs using a giant slab of it in preparation of orders.\\n\\nI definitely plan to revisit this place when I have more time to try different things. My advice would be to prepare to take home a doggy bag since they give huge portions even if they are half size. The best part is that prices here are very reasonable and you can get a lot of food for what you order.\\n\\nGab and Eat is located in a small strip mall just on the cusp of the entrance to Carnegie. It is easy to miss if you are looking for a particular building.\",\n",
       " u\"Very cute, little dive place (with an emphasis on little). Breakfast meals are my favorite. So, I thought everything on the menu looked delicious. I ended up ordering a breakfast bagel sandwich. I couldn't have made it any better myself. My mom ordered the half portion of the mixed grill which was a medley of sweet and spicy sausage, egg, home fries, and peppers. I also ordered a half portion of French fries, and they were absolutely perfect. These are my definition of the best kind of French fries. They're fresh cut, with the skins still on them.\\n\\nWe were in and out within 30 minutes with our stomachs full and happy. They only take cash though. So make sure you have some green in your wallet before you stop by.\",\n",
       " u'I would give this a solid one star. Let me tell you about my experience...\\nI walk in to a nasty glare by one of the waitresses before seating myself at a table covered in advertisements and a woman throwing menus at us before walking away.\\nThe waitress was a sweet old woman.\\nShe was nice, but hard of hearing and unattentive.\\nHere\\'s what I ordered:\\nTwo egg whites scrambled, links, Italian toast, and a half order of home fries.\\nHere\\'s what I got:\\nTwo scrambled whole eggs, Italian toast, and home fries.\\nI addressed the missing links with the waitress and she asked me if I still wanted them. I was starved by this point and said yes. I heard her to go the chef and ask for them, to which the woman behind the grill screamed, \"For what? Do you have the slip? Where is it? Where does it say links?\" in a considerably nasty tone.\\nThe eggs were mediocre, the home fries were unevenly cooked (mostly uncooked potato chunks, some practically ash), the links were so tasteless I stopped eating them as soon as I recognized I was full, but the toast was lovely.\\nThe prices are ok, but I\\'d prefer a college student\\'s hungover cooking to coming back here.\\n\\nUpdate:\\n30 minutes after leaving I got a vicious headache.\\n500 milligrams of acetaminophen later, my headache has gotten worse, new unpleasant symptoms have come along, and I may have contracted food poisoning.\\n\\nUpdate 2:\\nI have food poisoning. 100% definitely food poisoning. I haven\\'t eaten anything but pretzel rods and nutrition bars before breakfast here since 1pm the day before. I obviously haven\\'t eaten since. There\\'s actually no other place I could have contracted it.',\n",
       " u'Breakfast was real good. Toast was great. 3 of us all liked our food. Plus got sandwiches to go. Lots of food for a  reasonable price. May have to wait to be seated. Great small diner. Will return again.',\n",
       " u\"Trash.\\n\\nIf you've got time to explain to me for 2 minutes why you're too busy to take a to-go order, you've got time to write down my order and start making it.  \\n\\nGuess who wasn't too busy, Carnegie Coffee Company down the street.\",\n",
       " u\"Best I can say is that it's ok. Very small and compact. I went with my one and a half year old daughter and the booths are so crammed in that there is no room for high chairs (pretty sure they don't even have high chairs). They did have booster seats, but it was not ideal.\\n\\nFood was ok. Nothing special. I had sausage and cheese omlette and got a pancake for my daughter. Again, just ok.\\n\\nIt was hot in there and I don't think they have AC. There was a fan in front, but that did little for us who where sitting in the back.\\n\\nThis place is cash only. I didn't see anything on my way in stating that, but I could have missed it. It doesn't say Cash Only anywhere inside or on the menu either. There is an ATM, but it has a $2 charge to use. Can't believe a place in 2016 doesn't take cards.\\n\\nProbably won't ever go back since there are similar breakfast places closer to where I live that are more kid friendly, have better food and AC and accept more than just cash.\",\n",
       " u\"Sometimes you just don't need a fancy shmancy over-priced frilly frittata-ed brunch to get the job done. Sometimes you just want a greasy spoon diner that knows how to fry up some good breakfast.\\n\\nI love this place. The booths are falling apart, the waitresses aren't overly nice, and it's chaotic. But I can design my perfect breakfast because they serve half waffles and single French toasts! I hate having to choose between sweet and savory breakfast and, at Gab & Eat, you don't have to. Everything I've eaten here has been very good. \\nWaffles = gooood. \\nSausage Patties= gooood. \\nMixed grill = gooooood. \\nPepper, onion, sausage, cheese, and potato omelet = so so so good. \\n\\nYou really can't go wrong here. It's a great place for cheap eats!\",\n",
       " u\"Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  \\n\\nBarb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\\n\\nI know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try!\",\n",
       " u'Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.',\n",
       " u'This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often.',\n",
       " u\"My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\\n\\nThe food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\\n\\nThe service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\\n\\nThe inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\\n\\nThe prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\\n\\nSo in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's.\",\n",
       " u\"We go to Barb's every weekend and have for the past 3 years. The food is great,  the prices are better, and the coffee is the best! Try the barb wire omlette or the chocolate chip pancakes!\",\n",
       " u'My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It\\'s \"Seat Yourself\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I\\'m guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn\\'t see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don\\'t mind waiting for my food if I know it\\'s going to be awesome and they\\'re making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.',\n",
       " u'I love this place ! Barb is such an amazing person ,so down to earth and everything is homemade !',\n",
       " u'Never very busy. Food is great but sometimes takes a bit longer than other places, worth the wait though!',\n",
       " u\"For the price I ended up paying, this place was fine. There was a full kitchen, king bed and TV. I was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel. While I have stayed at other extended stay hotels, I was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per week...if you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it. If you needed fresh towels, you'd have to go to the main desk to get them. They also only provided a small bar of soap in the room...not the typical soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. This didn't bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things. \\n\\nThe hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from. The hotel was clean and the people who worked there were very nice.\",\n",
       " u'Great value, close drive to city, not much to do around hotel, its a business park. Carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants.',\n",
       " u\"Simple\\nRustic\\nLocal\\nWait that is every Gordon Ramsey review\\n\\nMy experience at extended Stay America was great. The staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as I left and when I returned in the evening. They went out of their way to provide A confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed. \\n\\nIf I ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel I wouldn't hesitate to head back there.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \\n\\nThe rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \"full kitchen\" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \\n\\nThe room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \\n\\nThe best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it.',\n",
       " u'Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful',\n",
       " u\"Front desk gets 4 starts\\n\\nHowever, if you're looking for a good night of sleep, you may not get it.  The refrigerator made a lot of noise at night every time the compress kicked on.  Likewise with the air conditioner.  If you didn't bring a hair dryer, you'll have to get it at the front desk.  There's a sofa bed but no extra pillows nor blankets.\",\n",
       " u\"Thomas Darby\\nI will never stay at this Extended Stay America due to the fact that we were there in October, 2015 and had an awful stay! Room was only cleaned one time after asking three times when it would be cleaned. There was absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen, 2 wash clothes, 2 hand towels and 2 towels. We had to take used wash clothes and towels to front desk every day to receive fresh ones. The toilet ran over and the heater didn't work until we decided to leave. We were over charged after booking through Hotels.com and had to put up a $100.00 deposit. For what? Never again will we stay there!!!!!\",\n",
       " u\"Visiting from California I stayed in Motel 6 for two days and i was not happy with it. Motel 6 didn't even had a shampoo. My boyfriend encouraged me to stay in this hotel where i can cook instead of spending money at restaurants. Only regret i have is i should have stayed here instead of motel 6. I was able to stay 1 night 2 days. And i honestly loved it. They even had iron and board that was useful. They also gave me military discount.\",\n",
       " u\"We traveled to Pittsburgh for a wedding and chose to stay at this extended stay. The photos were nice, and the reviews were decent. Front desk staff is very friendly and the room has spacious and laid out well and that's about it. The room was non smoking, which is clear that no one ever followed that rule. It stank so bad of smoke in there that when I came home, I had to wash my clean clothes because they smelled of smoke as well. Not to mention my allergies were in full effect. The bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of. The door opened to about 1cm from the toilet so you have to wedge yourself between the door and sink. Breakfast was pathetic. There was a row of fruit and a row of store bought muffins and a couple things of coffee, that's it. \\nI'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time.\",\n",
       " u\"Rooms were great big, bathroom is very hard to get out of like other reviews have stated.  I never remembered getting breakfast at extended stay thanks because you really don't coffee and granola bars is it.  The staff was awesome and very helpful!  The only reason 5 stars weren't given is because we stayed here because of convince to Pittsburgh well the freeway is currently closed June 2016 so it took us 30 minutes through neighborhoods and windy little roads to get in and out of hotel.  Wish we were notified before!  Otherwise great stay and clean rooms!\",\n",
       " u\"I have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends.\",\n",
       " u\"Let me start.. The service was a little sketchy, but the beer was cold and the food was amazing.  I would recommend paddy's to anyone.\",\n",
       " u\"Be warned. Don't expect the best service ever. It's not the cleanest place you've been in either. The decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams you've probably never heard of. It's divey, eclectic, and authentic. \\n\\nIf you're looking for good Irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the Pour House. Like most of Carnegie's Main St, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. They have some of the best Irish food I've had in Pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. If you're not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. I get it with a side of potato pancakes... Yum. \\n\\nAlso, they have Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp on tap...\",\n",
       " u'If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I\\'ve always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I\\'d probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would\\'ve been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once.',\n",
       " u\"Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again.\",\n",
       " u\"It looks so much better in here since they changed from Paddy's to Riley's. It's a shame, however, that they had to keep that same curmudgeon of a bartender that ruins the experience. Can somebody notify me once they get rid of him?\",\n",
       " u\"Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \\n\\nTo recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\\n\\nIt's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \\n\\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \\n\\nI really really want this place to do better. We need more Irish pubs and local old time watering holes. \\n\\nGet it together, Murphy's ... er, I mean Sullivan's....er, I mean Paddy's or is it Riley's? ;  ).  Whatever the case, they have cold Guinness. And Irish music.  And fun patrons.\",\n",

Rather than a thank you or a sorry, he just speeds off (breaking the speed limit on our block) to reach his destination 50 feet away.\\n\\nI would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and order from ANY other establishment in town.\",\n",

       " u'Some of the worst pizza I\\'ve ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn\\'t even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I\\'m serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \\n\\nWe also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \\n\\nI have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I\\'d never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again!',\n",
       " u\"Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town!\",\n",
       " u\"New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor.

I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. \\n\\nAbsolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised!

       " u\"By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!\",\n",
       " u\"When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect.\",\n",
       " u'In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\\n\\nWhen I look at Yelp reviews, I usually weed out the outliers (the best and the worst).   Unfortunately, there are only two reviews.\\n\\nIt was my first time at the office.   The office admin (very nice) asked for me to come early (before 9am) to complete paperwork.   I arrived at 8:50.    I waited.   I watched 2 employees walk by me (unlocked the door and re-locked it).    They did not acknowledge me.\\n\\nThe door I was at had signage (open hours).    I decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.\\n\\nThe office admin (very nice) called me to inform I am missing my appointment.   I explained to her that there were too many indications where this was not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.\\n\\nI recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\\n\\nPoor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review.',\n",
       " u\"I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else\",\n",
       " u'My family (husband and 3 young children) have been seeing Dr. Weinberg for a few years. We\\'ve never had an issue. She\\'s great with the kids, even my 6 year old who has autism. Scheduling and rescheduling appts is \"fine\", the wait time is fine, the care is fine. Basically I have had no issues, but I haven\\'t had my socks blown off either. It\\'s the dentist, it is what it is. I do find the dentist to be a bit frazzles, but we\\'ve never had an issue.',\n",
       " u\"All I need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see Dr. Weinberg and her staff! Not only are they professional and kind,  they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care!  This busy mom loves that they can provide two appointments, at the same time.  I can't imagine having a better family dentist!\",\n",
       " u\"Just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey.  She did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it.  I was able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few days of it happening.  I've gotten a few fillings as well after my chip was fixed.  The doctor is great and so are the staff.  I would recommend going here.\",\n",
       " u\"Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food.\",\n",
       " u\"Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.\",\n",
       " u\"Don Don is atleast as good as (although I personally \\nhappen to think better than) the majority of \\ninexpensive Chinese places best equiped for \\ndelivery and take out.  I've frequented many \\nsimilar establishments in different parts of the\\ncountry, and have also spent a few years in Japan.  \\nSounds odd, but they have some amazing Chinese\\n food out there.\",\n",
       " u\"Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.\",\n",
       " u\"I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \\n\\nThe last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \\n\\nAs for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \\n\\nThe workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking.\",\n",
       " u\"Delicious Singapore noodles and seafood delight. Crispy flavorful crab Rangoon, and cold sesame noodles done well (but could've used a bit more sauce). Excellent real Chinese food, friendly service.  Restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality.\",\n",
       " u\"I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).\\n\\nTo be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.\\n\\nIf nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated.\",\n",
       " u\"I use to order here fairly often.  The past 2 years their food has been getting progressively worse every time I order.  It doesn't help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time.  I finally decided that I'm done.  I don't think I should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant.  Let alone one that the food isn't even that good. Also the inside is dirty as heck.  They can deliver food in a BMW but they can't buy a scrub brush?  I have found Golden Dragon in Collier Square is 100 times better then Don Don.\",\n",
       " u'We visited Don Don Chinese restaurant in Carnegie a while back because we had the Entertainment Book coupon for buy one dinner get one complimentary dinner.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 regular dinners.  At the end when we went to check out and pay, the owner refused to honor the Entertainment Book coupon and offered a fruit cup instead, which we refused. \\n\\nThe food was acceptable, but refusing to accept the Entertainment Book coupon was not acceptable . \\nNeedless to say, we never returned.',\n",
       " u'I took my sick cat here and they charged me $$$$ for blood work and then never called me with results. I had to chase down the results and finally spoke to a different vet than the one who examined my cat. He said my cat \"absolutely did not have hyperthyroid\". They said my cat\\'s problems were behavioral and were rude and dismissive of my concerns. I finally took my cat to another vet who diagnosed him with hyperthyroidism. I\\'m trying medication now and I hope the illness hasn\\'t progressed too far. Otherwise I\\'ll have to have him put to sleep. Don\\'t take your cat here.',\n",
       " u\"I had gone here years ago and hated it. The doctors weren't very nice or caring. However, I wasn't happy with my current vet and decided to give the place another chance because I saw that all of the veterinarians had changed and the location is so convenient for me. I'm so happy I did! The doctor was great. We saw Dr. Martinovich after we adopted our new dog. She was so wonderful with him. She clearly loves animals. She was gentle with him and very thorough. The cost was higher than I had hoped but for the experience, I didn't mind. I will absolutely go back and plan on taking both of my cats here at some point as well. Very pleased! Great place.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUPDATE: Every single time we have gone to this place we have been satisfied.

       " u\"Dude... it's Denny's. It's excellent drunk food, packed on Sunday mornings, not very good.. but not really bad either. It's Denny's. When you walk into a Denny's.. you know exactly what you're getting into. Why the heck are you even reading reviews about a Denny's? That's like looking for reviews on an ice cream truck, you're getting the same thing no matter which one you choose.\",\n",
       " u'Excellent food , good service too I have had several different dishes here and all have been excellent',\n",
       " u\"Chose Denny's for a very late (1:30pm) Sunday brunch. No wait. Quickly greeted and served. I ordered the half size of Moon Over My Hammy. It was just the right amount of food for me, and the hash browns were delicious! Only thing lacking was Frank's Red Hot :-) Son and husband very pleased with their meals, can't remember the names but see pic. Patron next to us gave us $5 off $20 check, so our total came to $16! Would go back again for a casual meal.\",\n",
       " u\"I like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.\",\n",

I ordered a burger, fries, and a shake and all were really good and cooked just right.\\nDenny's has always been one of my favorite casual dining restaurants, so this one is worth a visit when you are in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm sorry to give any stars...15 minutes for a cup of coffee, while waitress flitted around...waited another 10 minutes and after 25 minutes of sitting there with the menu closed..I left.

Service is horrible and waitresses are the worst...food usually isn't great..but I can't speak for this visit...25 minutes and no one wanted to take my order. Ps...Kings had a great breakfast that day...service was great...only about 1.5 miles down the road.\",\n",
       " u'I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!',\n",
       " u\"I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym?\",\n",
       " u\"This is a gym, that part is true.\\n\\nBut it's not well maintained.  It's dingy and the locker rooms are abysmal, basically unusable.  There's a pretty wide range of equipment, but not enough of it to really go around.  If you're into free weights, that area is larger, but over crowded and very dungeony (personally I go for that, just saying).\\n\\nThe place must have a REALLY conservative owner as well, because all the TVs play FOX News all day long.  If you ask the staff for another channel, they will get around to changing it about half the time, the other half of the time you'll be ignored and forced to watch a bunch of awful talking heads tell you lies the entire time you're trying to run or lift.  Part of the problem is that the owner is cheap and not paying for cable where he can change the channel on the TVs individually.  They are linked to one box only.\\n\\nThe place also lets a whole ton of personal trainers basically do whatever they want.  This means that the area set aside for abdominal exercises, stretching, the rock climbing wall (which I've never once seen turned on or used) is over crowded with a punch of really out of shape people who are mostly carrying on conversations with their incredibly beefy personal trainers, because hey, the trainer is getting paid either way, if you want to waste your time chatting, they don't mind.\",\n",
       " u\"I really like this gym. It is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they don't have big contracts and they have flexible memberships. Great selection of classes. All the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating. All the staff working there are super nice. Their selection of the equipment is good too !!\",\n",
       " u\"I spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk, as a business is liable to their customers if someone was to slip and fall due to negligence on the business's part. He told me good luck and that I'm liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy. After two years at this gym I'm fed up with the way they treat their customers. He told me he was fed up with me since I gave him a hard time about being out of towels a few weeks ago (which they've had towels since then). They never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boots outside and don't crash your car. Aside from that, this gym is well just that a gym. My biggest critic (aside from rude management and negligence) would have to be that they don't encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room. There aren't towels and spray around the weight machines, which I've never had an issue with, but I'd hate to see that happen. I always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat marks from the machine, cause well that'd be pretty nasty. It is pretty large in terms of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weights and cardio. The workers well they're mostly young and don't really care too much (the man who told me I was wrong was older and possibly a manager or owner). They tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towels even when it isn't busy, which can be pretty annoying. Their cardio room always has Fox News on two tvs and then the middle TV has sports center on regardless of what else is on tv. They recently haven't even been putting pens games and stuff on. Must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the workers while the cardio room has max 32 in the middle and 24 on the sides probably. If I had to pay full price for my membership I probably wouldn't belong here, but it's through my insurance. That said I don't swipe my card like most people in the front on my own. The machine is behind the counter. One guy always shows me how to do it myself, which was helpful the first time cause people aren't always around the front desk. That said when he is standing behind there chatting I would expect him to do it since it's his job. This gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy, but do you really need a fancy looking gym? Their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hours I've never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical. They actually even have two hellix trainers, which aren't super common yet. Sometimes when things go out of order they take a while to fix them. I've run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if I should tell the guys at the desk and she said oh no they're useless. This gym makes a killing from a) classes b) it's convenient and c) their personal training is a separate company (warrior fitness). I've been meaning to sign up for a trainer and I always see them busy. They all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging. Not sure if they have a separate yelp page, but I would say from what I've seen they'd bust your ass for sure!\",\n",
       " u\"As a member for now 8 years I can honestly say, I have never had a negative experience at Amerifit!  The owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction.  The owner not only runs the business but personally fixes machines when needed, interacts with the members, and also personally salts and plows the parking lot when needed in the winter himself.  \\nThere is another review on here stating the lot didn't have any attention after which was the largest ice storm we've had in years. I would like to state I was sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot.  The owner was out there every couple hours doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot. However on that day I believe everyone's car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own.  If you truly felt in danger being on the roads that day, you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.\\nI love the fact the owner takes pride in his business and is extremely hands on with the maintenance of the building.  Amerifit has such a welcoming, no intimidation, home-like feel which is what I believe makes this place so special and unique and has kept my loyal membership for the last 8 years.\",\n",
       " u'This is review rating may not be for everyone.\\n\\nAmerifit is a gym where many serious body builders work out.   This is an anti-Planet Fitness (there are no pizza days).   This place is where private personal trainers take on clients who do not have an affiliation with Planet Fitness.  You can pay $5 per day if you want to meet occasionally.\\n\\nWhat the casual person may see upon entering:\\n\\nYou will hear lots of grunting and weights being dropped.   Do not be intimidated.   The folks (men and ladies) are doing this for competitions (usually).\\n\\nThe place may seem run down (older weights / machines).   Do not let this deceive you.   \\n\\nThe place may seem small.   Again - do not let this deceive you.  They have smaller rooms / areas.\\n\\nThey do have classes upstairs that seem pretty intense (not my cup of tea).\\n\\nWhy 4 Stars:\\n\\n1. I followed my trainer (which means I chose my trainer at a location where we could work out).   My previous trainers were great but I did not necessarily like the gym (too crowded or not enough room to work out).\\n\\n2. Equipment variety.   Example - Cardio Equipment.   Usually when you go into a gym, you will have a treadmill, a stepper, a recumbent bike, bike, elliptical) - All one type.    Amerifit provides a variety of machines such as Cybex.   Cybex is your traditional elliptical but you can control the elevation as well.   They also have machines that will simulate ice skating\\n\\n3.  Intensity - You do see people seriously working out.   This can either motivate or intimidate you.  It motivates me.   I can also see folks doing exercises correctly.\\n\\n4.  The folks are nice.   All the associates I have met are very nice.\\n\\nI apologize to the serious body builders for writing this review, but I think this is a very good secret to share.  Find you a trainer, meet him/her at Amerifit, and workout.   \\n\\nThis is not a chain gym where everything is new with standard (usually leased) equipment.',\n",
       " u\"I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\\n\\nMy pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us at the airport.\\n\\nWell, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. \\n\\nThe first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \\n\\nCan I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\\n\\nI know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :)\",\n",
       " u\"Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN.\",\n",
       " u\"This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.\\n\\n I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. \\n\\nThe place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner!\",\n",
       " u\"Thanks yelpers for this find. The service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. It was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter.\",\n",
       " u\"This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food.\",\n",
       " u'Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. \\n\\nI grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time I come to town.\\n\\nTry the fried calamari \"Roman Style\" for a little kick!',\n",
       " u\"I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.\\n\\nBoth times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\\n\\nFor entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \\n\\nThe service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \\n\\nI would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson.\",\n",
       " u\"I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.\\n\\nWe started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.\\n\\nI finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there.\",\n",
       " u\"What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\\n\\nFirst off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\\n\\nI am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \\n\\nThe server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \\n\\nBy the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \\n\\nOne of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \\n\\nThey had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\\n\\nOverall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!!\",\n",
       " u\"Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\\n\\nLike the dinning room with the hardwood floors and bright lighting.  \\n\\nThe bar was jumping thou never go to the bar.\",\n",
       " u'Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again!',\n",
       " u\"Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \\n\\nThe bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\\n\\nThe white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time.\",\n",
       " u\"We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. \\n\\nI had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it. \\n\\nIt certainly delivered. The crust was great, the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings were sufficient. \\n\\nOur friend for the baby clams with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - as good as the pizza was, this was _much_ better. \\n\\nWe'll return again to this beautifully lit gem in Carnegie PA soon!\",\n",
       " u\"OK, its Friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat. Driving by Papa J's and W says, lets stop in and get a quick dinner. \\n\\nAdvice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\\n\\nJust as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service.\",\n",
       " u'I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J\\'s. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \\n\\nFrom the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn\\'t know the menu. As I said before, I\\'ve been to PaPa J\\'s a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn\\'t explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn\\'t care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn\\'t have served us that regardless. \\n\\nBut before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn\\'t really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn\\'t remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn\\'t good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald\\'s that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren\\'t happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I\\'m not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\\n\\nMy opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at.',\n",
       " u'This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness.',\n",
       " u\"I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  \\n\\nMy daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.\\n\\nThe desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.\\n\\nI would return.\",\n",
       " u'san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice.',\n",
       " u'Coming here you get the feeling they haven\\'t changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\\n\\nI ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \\n\\nAmbiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don\\'t think I\\'d have this place on my list of \"musts\" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit!',\n",
       " u'Had dinner at Papa J\\'s with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\\n\\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\\n\\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn\\'t too thick, and the chicken moist.\\n\\nHard to tell if the deserts were \"homemade.\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \\n\\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J\\'s.  \"A-ok\" probably is the best way to describe it.',\n",
       " u'Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \"just\" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes ....',\n",
       " u'Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood',\n",
       " u\"Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.\\n\\nPapa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. \\nMy favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \\n\\nAlso, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food.\",\n",
       " u\"Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.\",\n",
       " u\"The boyfriend and I went about a year ago (early 2012) after recommendations from my sister.\\n\\nI had the salad - it was iceberg lettuce covered in essentially oil and salt.  It was so disgusting I couldn't eat it.  And Iceberg on an al la carte salad? with nothing else? ugh.\\n\\nWe had an appetizer of the stuffed pepper.  It was not even a hot pepper, and the cold meatball flopped on top was tasteless.\\n\\nFor dinner I had the pesto.  Essentially noodles swimming in green liquid.  Not a ton of flavor there either.\\n\\nThe boyfriend had the lemon chicken.  His broccoli was ROCK HARD - like wood! And the chicken was very dry.  We can make better food than was served.\\n\\nAfter what we paid and what we got for it, I don't even care to try it again. All of the good reviews amaze me.\",\n",
       " u\"Very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  We had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. The waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. Our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  Try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. Best steamed broccoli Iv'e ever had.\",\n",
       " u\"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \\n\\nI was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\\n\\nOrdered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back.\",\n",
       " u\"Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.\\n\\nWe LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)\\n\\nThe one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... \\n\\nNow... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!\\n\\nThe place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   \\n\\nSo good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine!\",\n",
       " u\"The menu has lots of choices and the food is great! The Resturante has been expanded so it's pretty large. The new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience! The bread is great and fresh baked daily!\",\n",
       " u\"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around.\",\n",
       " u\"Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place!\",\n",
       " u\"2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back.\",\n",
       " u'Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta!',\n",
       " u'I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well.',\n",

       " u'It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.',\n",
       " u'We stopped at Papa J\\'s last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\\n\\nMy friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don\\'t come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????\\n\\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \\n\\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\\n\\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J\\'s is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J\\'s. They understand the concept of  customer service.',\n",
       " u'Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.',\n",
       " u\"Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\\n\\nThe bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing.\",\n",
       " u\"Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG.\",\n",
       " u\"Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"Once upon a time, Papa J's was a great place to eat. Great food and knowledgeable wait staff.\\nUnfortunately, after a couple of very unsatisfactory meals we will not be going back. \\nLooking for a great Italian meal? Look elsewhere.\",\n",
       " u\"Well, Papa J's has officially priced itself out of our budget. We ordered 2 salads with gorgonzola and pine nuts and the total was $35.98!!! $18 per salad??!?!? Really?! I was stunned when I saw the bill! It's lettuce, cheese, and pine nuts! $18 / salad?! Totally crazy!\",\n",
       " u'Our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty.  We are not going back.!  The waitress started as attentive, but slowly slipped away to the point where things became frustrating.',\n",
       " u'Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated.',\n",
       " u\"Wonderful food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.\\n\\nI have friends that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.\\n\\nI love their fresh salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't get old.\\n\\nWe always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's just really plain. The alfredo is excellent.\\n\\nWe, almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.\",\n",
       " u'I struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me. First, the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown Carnegie\\'s main street. When you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with desserts and amazing looking house made breads. It rather looks like a deli counter. You have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area. A bit confusing layout, but tastefully done. The dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant. It felt much more upscale once in the dining area, but I did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique. \\n\\nThe food - A wide range of Italian dishes and seafood. We ordered the crab hozel as an appetizer. It was an average serving of lump crab meat, I had to ask for cocktail sauce. It was tasty, but cost us $18. We then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggies like artichokes, eggplant, peppers, etc. There were 4 smaller sized cutlets of veal and 3 shrimp. $28. There was no salad or pasta side offered. The dish was prepared properly and was OK. We just felt it needed something else. \\n\\nNow the bread that was offered to our table came in a small basket and was filled with a variety of their house made breads. The pepperoni bread was AMAZING! I mean really delish. This alone I would have given 5 stars. \\n\\nThe service - Our server was...well....I\\'m not sure what he was quite frankly. Annoying?Confused? Hyper?  He appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time. Bouncing around the table, asking the same questions over and over, forgetful, spastic, etc. At one point one of my colleagues said, \"Is he on crack?\" We chuckled, but seriously! He forgot to even ask us if we wanted dessert, which was too bad because we saw some amazing looking offerings in the cases as we were leaving.\\n\\nOverall - If I were in the area again I would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go, as they do sell it by the loaves. However, I think I would try somewhere else to dine.',\n",
       " u'Many trips to Pittsburgh over 20 years.  First time here.  Had the gnocchi special.  One of the best Gnocchi I have ever had.  Pizza was excellent.  Service was great!',\n",
       " u\"Did dinner with my GF last Saturday at PaPa J's prior to going to the Off The Wall Theater. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant. We usually stop a Riley's Pour House across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.\\n\\nThe place is deceptively larger than it looks from the outside. It was also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining tables which was located near the entrance and the bar. The traffic from both the customers and the staff that flowed past us was a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that's why it was one of the last tables available. But our waitress came by promptly, got us drinks (I had a Hoegaarden and my girl ordered an Absolute water and cranberry), gave us menus and recited the specials of the day.\\n\\nAfter viewing the menu for a bit, I decided on the Veal Parmigiano; my date went with one of the specials, a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish. The plates took about 15 minutes to arrive and the portions were humongous... enough for a filling lunch the next day. My veal was tender and delicious but it's really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression. You could tell that it was house made; it was like little fluffy pillows dissolving in your mouth with each bite. I never tasted gnocchi like it before.\\n\\nOver all I give PaPa J's a big thumbs up. The food was good, most of the dinning area's seemed cozy, the building itself has a certain charm with its high ceiling and the tables draped in white table cloths give it a pristine appearance. Although I thought it was a bit pricy, I didn't feel as if I've been taken.  Other than the location of our table, it was the pre-theater perfect meal. I only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner.\",\n",
       " u\"A unique and great find in downtown Carnegie. My fiance and I came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spots. We had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini's as an appetizer (these are never my favorite and were just OK, but the marinara served with them was very tasty, as was their homemade bread), I had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it was FANTASTIC. Not overly sweet, crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chips. Amazing. We will definitely be back here!\",\n",
       " u\"We came to Carnegie to check out the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real Italian dining experience.\",\n",
       " u'Ok a few things. First we walked in and asked for a table and was told it would be 5 mins. So after 10 mins, we were seated and there was 10 tables that were open! Why the hell was there a wait??? The older man that took us to the table could have done nicer. The bread was great and that was about it. The food was not bad but it was not good.',\n",
       " u'I wrote a letter to the Papa J\\'s, but did not receive a reply therefore I will share my experience online.\\n\\nTonight a friend and I dined at your location. We were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk, which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour specials. Our server took our order of a gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling).\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.\\nThe side salad was rather bland and unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce, a single slice of tomato and one black olive. I would have expected some additions such as onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots and the like.\\n \\n  We enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer, but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal, so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told us that he had forgot to \"put it in\". He offered to put it in at this point, but advised us that our meals would be out soon. We decided to just wait for our meals and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to. \\n \\n  The main dishes were acceptable, not outstanding. The eggplant was very tasty and well prepared.  The Chicken Piccata was flavorful, but not as expected.\\nThe chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked. It had no signs of being coated and saut\\xe9ed  to a rich golden brown. The chicken was just pale white.\\nThe sauce was a simple lemon flavor, it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken. I tasted no garlic or shallots. The sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by capers, which were absent.  No pasta was served with the chicken. The side of vegetables were well cooked, buy again lacked any real flavor. The would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugars.\\n\\n  Once our meals were finished  our plates were taken and we waited another 20 minutes for the check. The server seemed more concerned with what was on television rather than his customers. The total was $43 and change.\\nI would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order, but no such offer was made and \\nI saw no manager come around and check on the customers, as is customary.\\nI am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or  recommend it to anyone after tonights dining experience.  I hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business.',\n",
       " u\"This is it. My favorite in the Pittsburgh area. \\n\\nI moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get?!?\\n\\nI bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed. My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't into a special, you'll be fine - order off the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. \\n\\nWhen my better half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time.\",\n",
       " u\"I gave them 4 stars for two reasons - 1) they do not have fresh pasta and 2) my boyfriend's chicken Abruzzo was dry. The service was attentive and the bread was amazing. My Carbonara was incredible! The main dining room was a nice grotto style reminiscent of Rome; nice for couples and girlfriends catching up on life. I loved the Montpluciano in a carafe, but don't miss the extensive Italian wine list. We will definitely return to this Carnegie gem!\",\n",
       " u'Yummy Yum, Let me get me some.  This place rocks!!! Went here with the wife and had a great dinner.  Portions are very generous and the food is delicious.  Be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entrees, but they are worth every penny!',\n",
       " u\"Great restaurant. Had the Eggplant Parmesan and it was very good. Bradley was our server and he was on top of things all the time. Prices are reasonable and the decor is inviting. Can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " u\"We recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at Papa J's. There is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side. The food was perfectly prepared, served at the proper temperature, and was quite delicious. Portion sizes were quite satisfying. The complimentary bread and oil was excellent. The service was polite and efficient.\",\n",
       " u'Had dinner with a friend. My friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage. The waitress was extremely rude. He never did get the correct meal. When We talked to the manager, his answer  was .,\"well what do you want me to do fire the waitress?\" Too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude!',\n",
       " u\"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my wife and 3 other couples.  Another couple in our party had made reservations before hand and when we arrived a couple of minutes after that time, we were immediately taken to our table.  Whenever you first walk into Papa Js you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area.  That is pure genius on their part as both their desserts and bread look good!  Then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stairs.  After that I didn't really see much else of the restaurant.\\n\\nAfter our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink orders she came back up to our table and promised us that she would be back shortly as she had some desserts to take to a table.  After about 15 minutes or so she finally did make it back to our table.  For my dinner entree I decided on having the Romano chicken.  It came out a short time later with a side of broccoli.  The chicken had a nice golden color to its breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty.  I can take at least some credit for that though as I may have used the Parmesan that was on the table quite liberally.  Meanwhile the broccoli was over cooked for my tastes and seemed mushy whenever I bit into it.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  I wouldn't be the person to recommend it but I also wouldn't turn it down.  I feel like the prices were fair for what you got and only wish that the service was a little better.\",\n",
       " u\"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!  Reasonable prices & delicious food.  Only one weird quirk - they don't bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, but it doesn't come automatically). \\n\\nEverything is super fresh - my friends & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly recommend the panzanella salad.  \\n\\nThen, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good!  \\n\\nIf you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  Definitely enough to share (probably with a large table).\",\n",
       " u'We visited on 11/15 with a party of 15.  While I know a party of 15 can be overwhelming, we did call in advance for reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early and headed to the bar. The bartender there greeted us quickly and took great care of us. When it was time for our reservation we were seated immediately. That is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst. We sat for 20 minutes before a server came to our table. At that point, she said I\\'ll grab you water and bread.  Another 10 minutes go by and members of our party went to the bar to grab drinks as the server vanished (still no water or bread). She finally comes back to the table with bread (no waters) and takes our drink orders (about 40 mins into sitting at the table). Next thing we know, a nice gentleman by the name of Patrick is our NEW server. He really stepped up the service and should be commended. However, we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold. We also ordered the \"incredible white pizza\" which was incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible.\\nNot once did the front of house manager come check on us. \\nThis is the second time I\\'ve visited and the 2nd time I\\'ve been disappointed.\\nAlso, I wrote to the restaurant and received no response.',\n",
       " u'I never write reviews but my New Year\\'s Eve was ruined due to how awful my experience was. \\n\\nThe food was subpar but it was a lost cause by the time we got it. For $50 a person it was terrible. The menu was a small, select menu. I got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry. But as for the real issue....\\n\\nLast night for NYE we went for dinner with the intention of going out to celebrate after. we had reservations for 7pm made weeks in advance. We didn\\'t get our food until around 930 and didn\\'t get our check for another hour. We were there for an hour and a half before we even got bread. Everything we asked for was \"I\\'ll get it to you in a little bit.\" I ordered a drink 3 times and never got it. I don\\'t understand because it was not busy at all and they only had a select menu. You\\'d think they\\'d have a handle on things. How don\\'t you have salads ready and made in a cooler or bread baskets prepared when reservations were made weeks ago? \\n\\nAnyway, we all ended up missing our reservations at other events we had planned for after dinner. I\\'ll probably never go back again.',\n",
       " u'A large group of us have enjoyed an excellent dinner for the past three years and each year it gets better and better.  We order entrees from all areas of the menu. The bread and antipasto are exceptional.  Attentive and friendly staff with strong knowledge of the menu.',\n",
       " u'My husband and I dinned at Papa J\\'s last evening with another couple.  We came equipped with up to $ 14.00 off coupon we had planned to use, and they planned on using their Entertainment Book coupon.  We were told, rather harshly and rudely that we could only use one coupon per table...hard and fast rule of the establishment.  But we protested, there are 2 couples here, paying on separate checks, so can\\'t understand this rule.  Said they would take up to 3 Entertainment Book coupons per table, but not the one that drew us in from online Clipper Magazine.  What difference does it make which coupon you use???? If you allow one, why not the other!  Not building a \"come back\" attitude for us customers, and we don\\'t intend to go back.  Some food was really good, while other meals were just ok, esp. in portion size.  All menu items are ala carte, so pretty pricey, so coupon discount would have been nice.  Waiter we had, though he said he had been there for 21yrs, was pretty abrasive and a little neglectful with his service.',\n",
       " u'Worst service of all time. 2 hours for a pizza and had to repeat ourselves to the waiter 5 time throughout the night. Then asked for the bill and was given a bill 3 times the amount ours should have been with a bunch of items that should not be on there. Place is a total joke.',\n",

Wonderful wedding soup, obviously house made.  Every entree in our group was superb.  Chicken and pork dishes wonderful.  Pasta cooked properly and great sauce.  Wait staff were neatly well dressed and extremely cordial.  This restaurant is a must!  Had a great Pecan ball and luscious yellow cake for dessert.',\n",

I haven't been here in years and now I remember why. \\n\\nWe picked the calamari pepper topped for an appetizer and it was fabulous. It better have been at $13. \\nThey had numerous specials and the females picked the gnocchi entrees which were fantastic but at a price tag of $25 per, which we only discovered at bill time. Shame on us for not asking the price and no wonder the server was pushing those dishes. I had the chicken parm and it was a nice portion for $15. \\nThe cappuccino cheesecake was good but small at $6. The place was packed and drinks were sparse but the glasses were way too small.\\nOverall an expensive but enjoyable evening. If picking a special, do yourself a favor and ask the prices.\",\n",
       " u\"Fantastic gem in Pittsburgh. We were up in Pittsburgh for a family function and looking for a great Italian joint for dinner, we reviewed Yelp and discovered PaPa J's, we couldn't be happier! The food was spot on, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the meal. If your looking for authentic Italian, don't miss this place.\",\n",

       " u\"The last visit I overlooked the $25 gnocchi special. The reason it bothered me was they tell you the specials but not the prices. Okay, shame on us for not asking.\\nMy daughter wanted to try here again for her birthday. So I've decided I'd go against my not go there anymore and appease her.\\n\\nWe've been here 30 minutes and just got our water. Our appetizer has yet to come out. The bread is apparently just as scarce. Hey but we have a full cup of fresh parm cheese. \\nI ordered the chicken marsala and I was informed there's an up charge for pasta with my meal. Really? Potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala. \\nHooray the appetizer finally comes out and half ass warm and horribly bland. \\nWe asked for a manager and the waitress overheard us and asked us is there an issue. Ma'am please just leave us alone as we will speak to the manager. 5 minutes and crickets, yep you guessed it, no manager to our table. And to boot the waitress stood there staring at us which is why the ma'am please leave us alone. It was like she was a demon possessed. \\nBefore I imploded, we had to walk out. Never ever again will we return here. Time to find somewhere else to enjoy my daughters birthday.\",\n",

       " u\"I wanted to love this place. We started off with a Caesar salad, we asked is the dressing homemade we were told yes however I have had a number of homemade Caesars and this was deff not. They also topped it off with one crouton? My meal was the chicken breast with bone  in and broccoli. Chicken came out literally the size of chicken nuggets and my broccoli was basically raw and cold. I have three stars because the bread was actually really good and my finances meal was also mediocre. He had the eggplant rolitini and in my opinion it had a weird flavor. We would go back to try the pizza but I wouldn't suggest wasting 50 bucks on this meal.\",\n",
       " u'Literally just walked out after waiting at our table for 15 minutes with no server in site. We were never even offered drinks. It was embarrassing! Others came in after us ans were serves. Not us. Your food may be good, but the service is deplorable! Just so rude.',\n",
       " u\"This place is wonderful. My husband and I had our first date here so that's why we chose this place for our rehearsal dinner. The food is phenomenal. They were so accommodating for the guests we had that had allergies. They recommended various ways for us to save money like bringing our own wine and dessert. They were incredibly attentive and everything was just perfect. I can't say enough good things! Every time we come here the food is wonderful and the staff polite and helpful. We will definitely continue to keep coming back here for years to come!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm up in the air about how I feel regarding Emmert Dental. Being that it is located in Market Square can be both a good or bad thing. Parking is scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurants and coffee places around you. The office itself is old and raggedy looking but the staff are young and hip. I think possibly a little too young and hip. My dentist knew what she was doing but I didn't adore her. I'm still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and don't really seem to have all their info. together. After a cleaning and fillings, I think I'm going to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work done...\",\n",
       " u\"I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them.\",\n",
       " u'THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn\\'t know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \"dentist\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn\\'t feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \"bone graft\". So, I signed everything. I wasn\\'t even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \"dentist\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I\\'m assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn\\'t sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don\\'t expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers.',\n",
       " u'The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.',\n",
       " u\"Despite the low rating here on Yelp, I don't feel this dental office is all that bad. The office looks new or renovated, clean and organized. Emmert Dental has three locations: Settler's Ridge, Market Square and Bethel Park. I'm usually a patient of the Market Square location of Emmert Dental and so far, I prefer the Settler's Ridge location. I came here for an emergency appointment and this was the only office that could squeeze me in. I arrived 15 minutes early and they called me back exactly at my appointment time. The assistant was so friendly and made me feel comfortable at all times. The doctor was also friendly and made a great effort to make sure I left satisfied. I was in and out in a matter of minutes and the service was great.\",\n",
       " u\"I went here to have my teeth cleaned and they told me they found a cavity. Since I have never had a cavity in my life, I asked the dentist to show it to me on the x-ray and he said he wasn't able to. I didn't feel comfortable with his diagnosis so I went to another dentist (whose office is not a chain like Emmert) and that dentist did not find a cavity. This was three years ago and my teeth are fine, still no cavities. \\n\\nI don't believe in going to a dental chain and I don't recommend anyone else goes either. I have read horrible articles about their pushy sales tactics and performing un-needed procedures which is what I would have experienced at Emmert had I not been smart enough to find a second opinion. There are better, independent dentists in the area and I recommend people to go to them.\",\n",

We ordered food from Capri since we were going to voodoo brewery.  We ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an Italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones.  We ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an Italian wedgie, which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions.  No sign of Italian meat to be found.  No marinara sauce.  It was inedible.  We ended up walking to kfc instead.  \\n\\nI want to leave a zero star rating, but yelp won't let me.  So they get an undeserved star.\",\n",
       " u\"I judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni.  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street. \\n\\nWe ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.\\n\\nNext time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly, order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead.\",\n",

       " u'This is a typical Starbucks. The coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty.',\n",
       " u'I have to agree with Joe on this one.  The baristas are extremely friendly, and the service is great, but the fact that there are no comfy chairs or couches is very unwelcoming.  I do think however that the building is beautifully ans strategically located in the center of the shopping.  I just wish they had better seating.',\n",
       " u\"I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.\\n\\nThey've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. \\n\\nThe coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks...\",\n",
       " u'Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.',\n",
       " u\"Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing.\",\n",
       " u\"I love the location of this Starbucks, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's right smack in the middle of clothing stores, the Loews movie theater, as well as restaurants. I love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a Saturday while perusing various stores such as the Gap or Loft. I also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt.\\n\\nWhile the drinks are the same as you would find at any Starbucks, the baristas and staff are really friendly, perhaps more so than other area Starbucks. \\n\\nMy drink or choice when I come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti (or trenta...) berry hibiscus refresher. Yum! It is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated.\",\n",
       " u'This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\\n\\nSeating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\\n\\nBaristas are friendly and fast.',\n",
       " u\"As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\n\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\n\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\n\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them.\",\n",
       " u'I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. \\n\\nOutdoor seating in the summer is nice.',\n",
       " u'This particular Starbucks was especially pushy with offering extra espresso shots when placing my order. This has never happened before and it took me off guard.  The barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push.  I will avoid this one at the Waterfront for awhile.',\n",
       " u'Oprah Chai Latte! Great central spot in this out door mall. Staff was pretty efficient and fast.',\n",
       " u\"Starbucks is a chain coffee and tea shop you will find most everywhere. They offer free WiFi. They sell their coffees in bags if you like. They also serve sandwiches and pastries. Some of the Starbucks I've seen offer drive through services. Prices are reasonable.\\n\\nI stopped in here since I've been hunting all over for a gingerbread man cookie. They told me they are getting one in and ugly sweater design but they don't have it yet. I plan to keep checking since it appears that no place I have been to has my holiday favorite so I'll certainly be back to one of their locations.\",\n",
       " u'This is a typical Starbucks, but in a particularly cramped building without much room to spread out an work if you desire.  It is nice that it had a bit of outdoor seating and wifi.  Over several other coffee alternatives nearby in the Waterfront, I would rate this as low.  Barnes and Noble has more comfortable seating and access to many books and other amenities.  Panera also has more seating, cheaper coffee and a plethora of menu items to go along with the coffee.  The Starbucks building style an architecture is attractive, but just too small and limited for this busy Waterfront location.',\n",
       " u\"This is actually a very good Starbucks. The staff is always nice and they keep the store clean. It's definitely convenient if your down here shopping or going to see a movie. The only thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is the parking. Considering its in the middle, of the waterfront, parking can be a big problem.\",\n",

We were directed to this cats-only salon by a vet tech who recognized our dilemma.  \\n\\nThe staff at Cats Around Town were unintimidated, but respectful.  They made sure my cat felt secure and they took little breaks when they sensed she was getting too stressed out.

       " u\"I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\\n\\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....\",\n",
       " u\"It's your typical chain craft store.  And let me reiterate that I'm not a crafts person. I walked in because I needed dial rods for some signs I had. Now for being a chain store I was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection, the amounts they had for each one I wanted were scarce.  Imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief.  And for a piece of wood, the price was a bit steep.\\n\\nI will provably come back here, but only for an item that I cannot find elsewhere. Or if I'm too lazy to drive further out.\",\n",
       " u\"It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend.\",\n",
       " u\"The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \\n\\nI stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \\n\\nPlus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to.\",\n",
       " u'You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. \\n\\nThey are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it\\'s hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.\\n\\nThe organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There\\'s even a section called \"art supplies\". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. \\n\\nWhat did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael\\'s thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. \\n\\nSo, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don\\'t expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn\\'t completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael\\'s.',\n",

As I don't do much of this myself I didn't comprehend the significance of many of the items.\\n\\nI was impressed with the sales staff who with a few words immediately could identify the item you wanted and whether it was something they stocked.  If not, they had suggestions for where else you might find it.  Bought various crafting items for my girlfriend which she used to help me decorate my living room with.  \\n\\nMichaels also ha a wide variety of storage boxes useful for home organization.  The different sizes are helpful for planning storage in spaces of different dimensions.\\nI went back to Michaels to explore again and found some other useful items.

Between Christmas present purchasing and people wanting their house to smell like balsam and cedar, cinnamon sticks, or caramel pecan pie, the little store was packed. However, I was greeted immediately when I entered and was easily able to find the same salesperson again when I had a question. Since I was only purchasing votive candles, I was initially pleased to see an entire section for the store devoted to them but quickly became frustrated. I couldn't smell some of the votives through their thick, outside plastic. Since the votive candles weren't all displayed with their scents, I had to walk from the votive display to the fragrance display to better smell the scents and then walk back. Outside of that layout frustration, I had a pleasant experience in the store.\",\n",

The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.

But after we ordered, what really got me angry was that the food took a VERY long time to arrive. We had 2 kids with us and we ordered 2 kids meals, and had asked for those to be brought sooner. After about 25-30 minutes of nothing, I went to the servers (who were just NOT paying attention to us anyway - the main server\\'s name for our table was Angel) and asked where our meals were. One checked with another, who then informed me that they were working on it. \\nWhat made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything, telling me that it had only been 5 minutes. Then one of the servers (manager?) tells me that \"ok, may be it\\'s been 10 minutes, but it\\'s coming\". Then I hear some of the servers talking about our orders. The same gentleman then came to our table, sat down next to me and told me that it\\'s only been 10 minutes and that they were working on our order, and tried to give me some explanation about why that\\'s not really a long time at all. It was clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time. \\nThe food finally arrived about 10 minutes after that. But the food came cold. \\nWe were so HUNGRY by that point, we just ate whatever we could. Neither Angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even ONCE. I had to ask for mine, but by that point I was in no mood to take a sip even. \\nI paid ($58.20) and I again got the same gentleman who tried (again!) to explain to me that it was just 10 minutes, and that \"given everything, we were within normal limits\". Wow. \\nAfter about an hour and half at the restaurant, we all just shook our heads and left. \\n\\nI have written to them on their website, and will see if they follow up. \\n\\nWe have vowed NEVER to go to this restaurant again. Yikes!!',\n",

Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other.

As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed.\",\n",
       " u'I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\\n\\nGranted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn\\'t paid already.  \\n\\nWhile sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn\\'t that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\\n\\nWhen I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\\n\\nAll this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again.',\n",
       " u\"I don't think it's too much to ask that if you advertise your drive thru being open 24/7. Then it should be open 24/7. I work a late night job. The past three times I have tried to get food late night I haven't been able to. Twice they greeted me in the drive thru and never got back to me after twenty minutes so I drove away. Tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed. Really? Awful location. Awful service. Went inside to try to get food, but I was ignored by the staff. How hard does it have to be to get a burger? Don't go here.\",\n",
       " u'You know what you\\'re getting with a Steak N Shake: it\\'s about one rung up from a McD\\'s in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \\n\\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren\\'t very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven\\'t been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \\n\\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we\\'re girls, it\\'s acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she\\'s not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that\\'s right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn\\'t have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.',\n",
       " u\"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.\",\n",
       " u\"I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review, but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!\\n\\nI was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.\\n\\nI ordered a grilled cheese and fries. The grilled cheese was well cooked and filled with tasty, perfectly melty cheese. I love Steak 'n Shake's thin and crispy fries, and these were as delicious as I had expected.\\n\\nFor just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon.\",\n",
       " u'I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow...',\n",
       " u'Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour.',\n",
       " u'Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order.',\n",
       " u\"This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \\n\\nIt's the rare place I can get a Frisco Melt well, the ONLY place I can get a Frisco Melt!  and that steak burger alone is worth the risk, Walk In OR Drive Thru.\\n\\nJust take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine.\",\n",
       " u'The staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at 2:02 pm \"It\\'s only 1:59 you can\\'t do the happy hour shakes yet!\"   She literally screamed it at me.   The management does not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either.   I too, have witnessed employees not washing hands, and I have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burgers.   Once - shame on you, Twice - shame on me - won\\'t go there again.     The lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doesn\\'t help either when you have kids.',\n",
       " u'This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they\\'re supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \"doesn\\'t it come with the fixings like in the picture?\" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn\\'t even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers.',\n",
       " u\"Awful in every category. The service is the worst I've ever seen. We were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for 5 minutes before the manager came over and seated one couple. Then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down. We were still being ignore until I told him it was alright we didn't need a table and left. I don't know how corporate keeps this place open. I've complained numerous times but it never does any good.\\n\\nTake the extra 20 minutes to drive to the South Hills location. Its pretty much the exact opposite of the Waterfront. The food comes out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff.\",\n",
       " u\"Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there.\",\n",
       " u\"It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice.\",\n",
       " u\"I like to eat here because the food has always been good and kids eat free on the weekends which is great. But this location is always woefully understaffed, with five or six tables sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated. Whether you're inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long. Fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing levels the management maintains here.\",\n",
       " u\"I am not a fan of this chain's food or this locations service.\\n\\nHowever!  \\n\\nSteak n Shake milkshakes totally rock.  Very thick, regular is the perfect size to get me home from the Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"I really don't know how this place stays open. I've been here a couple of times. The service is slooooow. They bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it, put your Bill on the table and never come back to check on you. If the place was packed I could understand but it's usually about half full. On our last visit it took us 10 minutes to get our waitresses attention. We asked for some mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes for our burgers. It took 5 minutes to get the mustard and mayo. The lettuce and tomato never came. \\nIt's safe to say that we won't be back. We like the food and shakes but not worth it to put up with the poor service.\",\n",
       " u'Fell asleep last night before I did my review what I can say about this place is their food is good their milkshakes r awesome I had gotten the chicken fingers with fries & a birthday cake milkshake which was delish we got seated pretty fast & our waiter was very polite & professional',\n",
       " u'Drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout. Food is always served hot- inside it just takes a lot longer than it should, both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come. Also, the lids on the milkshake cups are awful and fall off easily. Make sure to hold on tight!',\n",
       " u\"The hostess (Jenn of Jess, I'm not sure) is atrocious. I am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise levels, and she made a huge deal of it. I ended up crying outside waiting for my partner to let me know we'd been moved. 15 minutes later, we had still not been moved or gotten food, and my partner and I left. This is 1:45 PM on a Thursday. Not at all busy. Just bad service. Our waitress was very polite, though.\",\n",
       " u\"I have eaten here before and never had any problems. But today was completely different. I arrived 12:15 PM to have lunch with my family. We sat there for about 25 minutes and not one person came to ask us if we were ready to order. They completely ignored us so we got up and left. One table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention. So we went to  Wendy's up on 8th Avenue and we had no problems ar all.\",\n",
       " u'Slow service. Food is VERY cheap though. The milkshakes are huge thick and yummy. Sometimes when I go here, they completely ignore you when your the only person in line. The burgers were good and the menu is pretty small. Food takes about an hour to come when no ones even there! I would go here if the service was faster and better.',\n",
       " u\"I know service speed isn't a chain-wide issue. This place is just REALLY. SLOW. We ordered 40 minutes ago. Still no food.\",\n",
       " u'I ordered online last night and it was suppose to be done at 7:!5pm. I get their small line that somehow took 30mins. When i get to counter she looks at my print out and says it will be done in a few. I ask to speak to manager and she calls out a manager named Rachel who did not show. At 8:05pm she goes to check my food after me saying something! It was on the counter the whole time. My Food was cold and they have to the nerve to say come again. I Think Not!',\n",
       " u'Dear my fine brethren,\\nA man once asked me: have you ever seen the rain? Well I have. The burgers were charred to a crust-encased oblivion. Imagine world war 3. And by God, the viscosity of the milkshakes was uncouth. \\n1/5',\n",
       " u\"..such an upsetting experience here. My family lives an hour away and came in town for dinner and Dave & Busters. We knew D&B's food was overpriced and always a long wait so we decided on here. \\n\\nWe were a party of 6 adults and 1 kid. Raquan was our server and he was so nice. He took our order but sadly we waited 45 minutes for it to com.Everyone around us who just ordered 15 minutes before already had their food. I've worked at steak n shake before. it less than 10 minutes to cook both the burgers and fries. I have no idea if kitchen lost our ticket or what but i did see our server talking to them more than once about our order so atleast he was on top of it.\\n\\nThe manager here needs better training. He stood at the register the entire time cashing people out even though clearly the kitchen was behind and customers in the dining area were angry (saw a couple leave after waiting for server and another table talk to manager about wait time). Again i've worked at another steak n shake. The counter girl is responsible for cashing people out and take out orders.. manager should helping on the grill or over-seeing everything going on. Poor Raquan had to keep coming over to apologize whenever the manager should have. Who tf trained the boss here?\\n\\nSadly after an hour at the restaurant and 45 minutes waiting on food, we told our server we had to leave. He told us dont worry about the drinks. We tipped him and went to eat at chikfila. At least the rest of the night was fun at D&B. \\n\\nshoutout to Raquan . You're the real MVP\",\n",
       " u\"I waited 20 minutes for charred hamburger. The bottle of seasoning on the table was a cute idea bc lord knows it didn't have any seasoning on it. The waitress kept saying that they were backed up but when I looked around there wasn't a lot of people there. However they (waitresses) were nice and apologetic. But when I think of steak sandwiches I didn't think of what I got.\",\n",
       " u\"My goal of 2016 is to write more Yelp reviews... So here we are. My boyfriend and I just spent an hour at Target getting stuff for our new house. We were hungry and wanted to grab something quick, so we went to Steak and Shake. I would first like to note that their parking lot and sidewalks had NOT been salted... Not really the best idea considering it's been icy out for two days now. Anyways, we made it inside and it was pretty crowded. We were seated within 5 minutes of coming in. The  service was OK, nothing special. I ordered the single cheeseburger and cheese fries. My boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger and cheesy bacon fries. Our food came out pretty quickly and it was the way we ordered it (I ordered everything on my burger while my boyfriend only ordered cheese and bacon). Our food was good, I have no complaints. If you're looking for a quick and cheap bite to eat, then this is your place!\",\n",
       " u\"Server took 15 minutes to even seat me, then 10 more to even take my order. Found out they didn't even have what I wanted, a common accurance lately. Once I had got my drink(COLA with a shot of cherry), it was flat and tasted a little like cough syrup. Their first attempt at my meal, grilled cheese steak burger melt(in essence a steak burger on a grilled cheese), I was served just a plain grilled cheese. Once they had gotten me another sandwich, it seemed right except for the awkward stack of pickles in the middle, not spread out. It may seem a little nitpickey at this point, but this is by far the worst experience I've had at this restaurant, but not the first. I don't think I'll be returning to suffer through that again.\",\n",
       " u\"Waitress was very kind at the beginning but her attitude declined rapidly. Food was alright except the French onion soup. Couldn't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve. A table nearby had a problem with their food. Waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue. Terrible customer service.\",\n",

       " u'I keep forgetting how not good this location is.\\nInconvenienced hostesses seat the party before you without even acknowledging your presence. Disinterested, apathetic servers that ignore requests like \"we need napkins\" until you have finished your meal and erupted your hands on your clothing. Cooks meet my food quality expectations, but give barely child sized portions on side dishes. I have not seen one staff member smile the entire time I\\'ve been in here today.\\nI consistently return to the Rt 51 location because I get decent and consistent service. This one? I only returned because I was getting my dog groomed at the nearby Petco.',\n",
       " u\"As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go.\",\n",
       " u\"Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \\n\\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\\n\\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.\",\n",
       " u\"Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's!\",\n",
       " u\"This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often.\",\n",

       " u\"Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\\n\\nSo there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\\n\\nThey played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\\n\\nPart of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\\n\\nMy friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\\n\\nIf in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun.\",\n",
       " u'While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we\\'d see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It\\'s apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\\n\\nSing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB\\'s in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV\\'s, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn\\'t a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I\\'d say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\\n\\nThis particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE\\'s party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\\n\\nThere were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto\\'s Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV\\'s \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\\n\\nI will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I\\'m not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn\\'t bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\\n\\nDrinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn\\'t brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn\\'t scary and I\\'m not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \\n\\nThe only down side to everything was group seating as you\\'re sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \\n\\nOoops!\\n\\nAll and all a good time and someplace I\\'d certainly return to if for any reason I\\'d be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car.',\n",
       " u\"In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\\n\\nThe 2 stars are for the piano players, who are entertaining and very talented, and the Rock Bottom brews they serve.\",\n",
       " u\"So.Much.Fun! \\n\\nI WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. \\n\\nThis is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. \\n\\nKeep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \\n\\nThe guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \\n\\nMy favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). \\n\\nThe birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!\",\n",
       " u'Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \"waterfront\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\\n\\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin\\' Alive to She\\'s My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who\\'s song they sung.\\n\\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it\\'s stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you\\'re the piano man has run it\\'s course. I don\\'t hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It\\'s a been there, done that kind of place.',\n",
       " u\"If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :)\",\n",
       " u\"Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)\",\n",
       " u\"What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\\n\\nHonestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \\n\\nI am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends.\",\n",
       " u\"Came here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. We paid the cover, walked in and it was absolutely packed. There was nowhere to even stand. One of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in, they let us get our $7 cover back without issue. \\n\\nI recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. \\n\\nThey brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. There are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. They also have mixed drinks and wine. The mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu). \\n\\nThe entertainment was great and I would recommend it for a group outing. But definitely make sure that you have a reservation.\",\n",
       " u'Lame. Lame as heck.\\n\\nThe premise seemed kind of fun, but when I got there it did not take long for Sing Sing to disappoint. The $7 cover was way too high for this place, and the drinks were not good. The music the guys played was all stuff from like 1987. Nothing modern, mostly stuff you would hear on Bob FM during the two o\\'clock hour at work. The medley from Grease was a crowd pleaser I guess.\\n\\nPart of their schtick is that if a member of your party is having a birthday or wedding or what have you then you can pay to have that person dragged on stage and they will sing a song to them. They were doing dirty versions of well known songs, and there was really only one joke.  \"Hey there Delilah\" became \"Hey There V****a\" and that was the cleverest one. Hope you like 7th grade dirty jokes, because you\\'ll be hearing a lot of them. Mostly ones that you already know from 7th grade.\\n\\nI would not recommend anybody go. I want my brain cells back.',\n",
       " u\"This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun.\",\n",

A unique musical experience found in Homestead.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They\\'ll play anything you\\'d like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.\\n\\nThe crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it\\'s harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you\\'re wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It\\'s the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn\\'t want that?\\n\\nDueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!',\n",
       " u\"First time here tonight and I must say I wasn't sure if I wanted to go. It seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but I decided to go with friends and man did I have a blast. The $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). The food was not super but good prices reasonable. The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it. The musicians were great they made this place awesome. We will b back and this may b our new Pittsburgh hangout\",\n",
       " u\"Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!\\n\\nIt was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \\n\\nI had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \\n\\nI did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!\",\n",
       " u'My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn\\'t really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \\n\\nIt was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they\\'re covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It\\'s obvious they\\'ve been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it\\'s rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta\\'s Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\\n\\nI saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there\\'s not even an intermission. I\\'ve read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend\\'s birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\\n\\nThere were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can\\'t laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\\n\\nLuckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\\n\\nSing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbr\\xe4uhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list.',\n",
       " u\"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \\n\\nShut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \\n\\nMy big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses.\",\n",
       " u\"The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\\n\\nOtherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile.\",\n",
       " u'I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \"you bitch, you slut, you whore\" and  \"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don\\'t you take it up the butt\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not.',\n",
       " u\"He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.\",\n",
       " u\"Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again.\",\n",
       " u'My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \"Rock Bottom\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy\\'s bachelor party.\\n\\nThere were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it\\'s not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren\\'t so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I\\'ll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it.',\n",
       " u'Talented piano players, but I found it annoying they kept pushing for tips all night long. We got the message. Server was nice and songs were good. It was super loud in there so be prepared. Super crowded Saturday night so make sure you come early',\n",
       " u'What a great time! The pianists are funny, talented, and just a tad crude. But just enough to be funny.',\n",
       " u'Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend.',\n",
       " u\"What a fun place!! :) The 2 guys playing piano and telling jokes are great!\\nWe went there for drinks on weekend and the place had a good crowd. It's definitely entertaining and fun. Not family friendly though!\",\n",
       " u\"Sing sing is a great place to change up the pace on a Saturday night! We had a large part of 22 people so my sister took care of the reservations, but by the looks of it, it seemed like every table was reserved! My suggestion is that you call ahead and reserve a table for however large your party is. Don't forget it's $7 to get in unless it's your birthday it's free for you! If you eat at rock bottom it's $3.50 for you to get in! \\n\\nThis is a dueling piano bar and its definitely a great time! The musicians are very talented and can play the drums,piano,and harmonica. Well that's what it was this night!  They played all different kinds of genres! No complaints about their musical talents for sure! The only downfall is that they could be very vulgar towards the crowd, but it's all in good fun! That crude humor didn't bother us at all! \\n\\nThe service of was fantastic l! Our server had to deal with 22 of us and didn't miss a beat at all! \\n\\nSo you ask why 3 stars, well 3 stars because of the price of alcohol!! That was a BIT ridiculous, but at that moment when your a little tipsy it doesn't seem to phase you until the next day!  It was over $9 for a vodka tonic!!! AHHHHH what kind of highway robbery is that?!??\\n\\nBut all in all its a great change of pace! We would do it again, but definitely not drink as much the best time!\",\n",

       " u'I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done.',\n",
       " u'I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn\\'t believe how annoying it is when businesses don\\'t do this during normal business hours. They\\'re so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn\\'t turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it\\'s a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.\\n\\nFran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio\\'s (with an \"i\" not an \"l\") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.\\n\\nOverall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn\\'t match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them.',\n",
       " u\"From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio's, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!\\n\\nIf you don't want any hassle, want to be treated with respect, and want your car looking fantastic, give these guys a call!\\n\\n-Adam\",\n",
       " u\"Joe Dilorio's Auto Body Shop was so helpful when I needed to get windows replaced. The were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area. They were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with. I'm planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs.\",\n",
       " u\"This is the best place we've ever taken our cars to. Their customer service is outstanding.

I completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is amazing! I needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful.

I can't recommend this place more!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm grateful to my insurance company for recommending Di Iorio's Auto Body Shop. After an accident, I needed some body work done as soon as possible. The other recommended shops wouldn't even make an appointment to see me for days. These guys fit me in that afternoon, and coordinated the rental too. Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense. The car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few days later, I noticed they had buffed out some scratches that weren't even part of the repair area. I will definitely be back next time I need auto repairs.\",\n",
       " u'I had a good experience with this body repair shop several years ago, so took my car back again recently.

       " u'SO lucky to be referred to Joe DiIorio\\'s after moving to Pittsburgh. I\\'ve been taking my cars here since 2011 and I recommend them to everyone. It\\'s really invaluable to have \"car guys\" that you trust. I could detail many experiences here (in comparison to other chain shops), but suffice it to say that they\\'ve always been honest, helpful, and fair.',\n",
       " u\"You can find pretty good body work without too much trouble.  Finding a place that's friendly, prompt, and organized that ALSO does good body work is more difficult.

       " u\"Amazing repair service. I hit a really fat raccoon in the Appalachians (it was dark and rainy and I didn't see the poor thing until it was too late) while going fairly fast down a hill. The raccoon destroyed my front bumper, the grill, and my right fog light. Thankfully I had duct tape in my trunk. Anyway, once I got back to Pittsburgh, I called my insurance agent.\\n\\nMy insurance referred me to DiIorios and I'm really glad they did! The staff was very friendly and helpful doing the estimate. They even set up a rental for me when I was having the car repaired. \\n\\nThey kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time.\\n\\nHopefully I don't have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon, but if I do, I know I'm going to take back to DiIorios.\",\n",

We decided to pay $35.00 to have an installer come to the house and measure so that  Lowes can install the doors. We would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed. After the installation, Lowe's would refund us the$ 35.00. Our paperwork said we would receive a call from an installer within 2 business days. I also had a few other questions that our salesman said the dept Manager would call me about the next day. Never received a call from anyone at Lowe's! By July 2 we still had not heard from the installer or the dept Manager. I called the dept manager and asked him my few questions that I had. He answered one question and said he would have another millwork person call me. Millwork never called me! By July 3, I called our salesman (David Crane). He was surprised that I had not heard from the installer. He told me he would send a message to the installation dept about calling us.Today it's July 8th and we STILL have not heard a peep from anyone at Lowes. Our total order that we planned on spending at Lowe's was around $1700.00 !! I called today and asked to talk to a store Manager. I told him that we have not heard from anyone at Lowe's and that we are not going to proceed with our order. I told him we would like our $35.00 back. He said OK, just bring in your receipt the next time you are at the store. He never apologized, he never even asked me what my customer number was so he could look up our order and maybe somehow save this sale !!!! I cannot believe how unprofessional this store was !

He didn't have exactly the fitting for a hot tub, but gave me what he thought would work. It did! Under $3 bucks later and all was a go! Winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot.

Their garden section is great for Spring planting.  They have competatively priced appliances.  5% off with Lowe's credit card is also nice.  Having those large items delivered is a convenience.

Justin was satisfied with his meal. Its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but I wouldn\\'t recommend going out of your way.',\n",
       " u'Great atmosphere and even better people----wait staff was very friendly and the French Onion soup was amazing....Definetly recommend the home made chips...\\n\\nGreat Bar in the up and coming Homestead area.....Highly recommend',\n",
       " u\"We're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the Waterfront (they do exist...), and this has become a favorite. I've had the Hot Roast Beef & Fries and the Corned Beef on Rye, and both were delicious. Every beer I've had here has been ice cold, and the service has been strong too. It's a great place to watch a Pirates game too.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months.\",\n",
       " u'Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders.',\n",
       " u\"This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.\",\n",
       " u\"There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front.\",\n",
       " u\"Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\\n\\nThe place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back since I live in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\\n\\nThey have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. \\n\\nIt is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \\n\\nThe biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \\nTheir fries are very good. And so are the wings.\\n\\nI'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.\",\n",
       " u'Food is good here. Great beer selection on tap. Sometimes the beer is on the pricey side. What I want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special. Pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches. Good place to watch football, hockey, baseball.',\n",
       " u'One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family.',\n",
       " u'Came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the Franktuary truck at Voodoo Homestead. I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings. For $19 you got a large cut of meat, which was pretty tasty, a large side salad, and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side. They were a little chintzy with the sides. The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing. The food was all pretty good, with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear. As always, the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy.',\n",
       " u\"We recently ordered fish sandwiches from here. They were HUGE! We did get the large, but it was so big we could've just shared one. \\n\\nWas not over fried. The French fries were hot and also very good. We will definitely be going again to try something different.\",\n",
       " u\"If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  \\n\\nMy favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  \\n\\nI've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to Dukes last week. They have really renovated the place, and added a lot of large screen tv's. The best part, tho, is the vast improvement in draft beer selection. I counted 46 beers on tap. If you are a beer head and are at the Waterfront shopping are, this is definitely one of your best choices.  The food is above average, and the selection is common pub fare.\",\n",
       " u'I find it frustrating to read bad reviews about great bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing. I eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great. I have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad meal. Great draft and great service. This is the best bar in this area.',\n",
       " u\"I went to Duke's Upper Deck Cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit.  I went there to watch an Elite 8 game, and felt a little out of place as I was the only person in the bar that didn't seem to know everyone who was there.  However, that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable (I was cheering for my alma-matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if I was loud).  \\n\\nThe drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options. The food was just OK.  I ordered the wings, which were very good in a unique way.  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it. Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them, messy but delicious. I also ordered the pita pizza, i would not recommend this as it just wasn't very good.  \\n\\nI am looking forward to returning to Duke's this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings.\",\n",
       " u'The chili dogs rock!  The portions are huge so come hungry.  Big selection of appetizers that go beyond the standard bar food list.  Great selection of draft beer.  Noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner.',\n",
       " u'Love dukes and love the food. I wish i could figure out the closing times or i wouldnt plan so many after work gatherings. Their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their prices are standard for crafts and actually pretty cheap for domestic',\n",
       " u\"I really don't see how anyone could give this place a bad review.  The food is fantastic and if it's not my belly luring me in then it's the awesome beer selection they have.  \\nMy suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu...\\nThey often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)\\nAnyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!\",\n",
       " u\"My boys and I stopped here for dinner one night. It was cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here.  Our server was extremely nice. The menu had lots of options. They are kind of known for their potato soup so that's what I had. It is very good. It's a very thick soup that is velvety smooth. I would definitely order it again. It was perfect for a rainy night. \\nMy youngest son had chicken tenders. They looked a little over cooked but I tasted one and it was good. The coating was crispy and the chicken was juicy. My older son ordered wings with their house made sauce. It was good but not spicy enough for him. I thought it was good and would order it the next time I go.\",\n",
       " u'Had corned beef sandwich. Meh. \\n\\nOnion rings were horrible. Extremely breaded and doughy. Greasy as all get out. I hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading comes back, as I had to peel it away to get to the onion.',\n",
       " u'What a cool place in Homestead. Love the environment and the food was really good. Stop here then head to the Waterfront to see a movie. It will be a great night.',\n",
       " u\"Thank god for the draft list is all I can say. 3 things that were ordered were all wrong. Asked for no onion on all 3 and they all had onions on them . The place was not busy at all so if it was I could understand. The burger was solid though , steak on the salad was ice cold even though we were asked how we wanted it cooked so I assumed it was cooked to order and would come out at least warm. The inside of the place was clean and neatly decorated so that is a positive. Really loud place inside. I'd come here for the awesome draft selections but might pass on the food.\",\n",
       " u\"Cool place to hangout. Good food, good prices and selection on beer and solid service. Geographically not in the most convenient of locations though, so that's why it's getting 4, not 5-Stars. Would recommend going here.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped for late lunch yesterday (3/4/16).  Extensive draft beer selection, by which I was pleasantly surprised (many neighborhood pubs in Pittsburgh, it's Bud Light, Yuengling or nothing, it seems).  Food menu is large and pretty typical pub fare, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, etc.  Ordered the tuna melt special, which was nothing spectacular, but tasty enough.  Pleasant atmosphere and bartender was very friendly.  Would like to go back when the weather is better and the back deck is open.  Overall, a good local alternative to all the chain places down in the Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"The transformation of this place is beyond amazing. If you haven't been there in a while you owe it to yourself to check it out. Clean and consistent. Friendly and fresh. Hands down our favorite place to eat in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"2 strikes. Enjoy the fact that there are other options in the area like Dukes but our last couple visits have been very disappointing. \\n\\nHate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I've ordered the past 2 visits. \\n\\nI can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost. \\n\\nLast visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today. \\n\\nI felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I'm not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I'm not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining. \\n\\nDecent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren't very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar? At least say something/acknowledge the customer that has been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink.\",\n",
       " u\"Duke's is one of Pittsburgh's best kept secrets in my opinion and one of my favorite spots to drink. The interior is really nice, the outdoor section is also really spacious and great for warm weather days. Beer selection is great and the bartenders/waitstaff are ALWAYS on their game. When I come with large groups I find that the waitresses are always very attentive and quick on their feet. If I had one minor complaint it would be with the food. Some people might like it but when it comes to appetizers I just find that they go wayyyy overboard with the greasiness/breading. I would highly recommend Duke's to anyone who is looking to mix it up.\",\n",
       " u\"GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!  \\n\\nA FAMILY GATHERING!  \\n\\nA WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!  \\n\\nOR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!\\n\\nA combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!\\n\\nThe Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.  \\n\\nThe Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\\n\\nThe one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\\n\\nWonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure. \\n\\nWHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.  \\n\\nPOWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.  \\n\\nA GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games. \\n\\nTime will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!  \\n\\nDAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!\\n\\nFUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!\",\n",
       " u\"D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\\n\\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\\n\\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\\n\\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\\n\\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.\",\n",
       " u\"This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.\\n\\nWalking into such a huge space, especially coming from the often narrow venues in San Francisco was strange.\\n\\nUn-nerving actually. \\n\\nBecause Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.\\n\\nAs far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.\\n\\nBut most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.\\n\\nAnd while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.\\n\\nEspecially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.\\n\\nTrust.\",\n",
       " u\"Think Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Skee Ball, video games pool tables.  Clean environment.  Good fun.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\\n\\nMy mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.  \\n\\nI like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.\",\n",
       " u'I love the games here but can\\'t go very often since they don\\'t rotate new games in very often.  The place is usually pretty clean.\\n\\nPool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you\\'ll find in the city.\\n\\nFood is just \"ok\" Drink prices are fair but not great.',\n",
       " u\"Dave and Buster's is an enigma, is it dining, a bar, or  playground for video game lovers? Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill. \\n\\nNext, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. \\n\\nThe games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.\\n\\nOverall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.\",\n",
       " u'Because I have significantly younger sisters, I go to Dave and Busters about twice a year. It\\'s fun for them and nostalgic for me. It can get expensive and the \\'prizes\\' are cheap but it make for great \"sister days\" \\n\\nAs for the food, we\\'ve eaten there once and never again. It\\'s just blah... frozen and fried. The veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. A frozen Boca patty thrown on a bun. Thanks! I could have ran to Costco for that. Drinks are rather expensive but that\\'s to be expected. \\n\\nSo go for the games, fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the Waterfront and try Blue Dust on Amity Street).',\n",
       " u\"The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \\n\\nOur waitress was awful but they were extremely understaffed so I would have a bit of an attitude if I had to wait 10 tables without assistance too.   \\n\\nThe manager was really nice... Of course that disgusting sandwich that I didn't eat was free.\",\n",

       " u\"We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.\",\n",
       " u'A table for 16 please...   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate.\\n\\nI happen to be in the Homestead area for work.   I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the \"Shock and Awe\" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.\\n\\nWhen I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.\\n\\nWe decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.\\n\\nIt is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.\\n\\nThe waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.\\n\\nIt was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.\\n\\nMy team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.\\n\\nService - very good\\nFood - okay, not great.   My meal was $13\\nAmbiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B\\n\\nThere are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.

       " u\"When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\\nI get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\\nOn top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\\nThe hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\\nFinally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \\nI had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \\nAfter dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \\nAll in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.\",\n",
       " u'Not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here.  But it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out.  I ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games.',\n",
       " u\"My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)\\n\\nThe games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. \\n\\nI think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.\\n\\nDrinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks.\",\n",
       " u\"Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \\n\\nDining: 2 stars\\n\\nI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \\n\\nWhen my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\\n\\nThe food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\\n\\nBar: 1 Star\\n\\nDrinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\\n\\nArcade: 4 Stars\\n\\nThere are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\\n\\n\\nOverall: 3 Stars\\n\\nIf you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.\",\n",
       " u\"Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).\\n\\nFirst let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\\n\\nThe building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\\n\\nSpeaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\\n\\nI will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.\",\n",
       " u\"Not really sure what to add.  So I'll bullet point my experience.\\n\\n- Expensive poorly made drinks\\n- Friendly but slow service\\n- Ok food considering (Had the Philly Steak and Cheese)\\n- Over run with kids before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision\\n- 15% of the games were out of order (Air Hockey, Big Bball Game, 1/2 of the skee ball, random other arcade machines)\\n- Expensive games\\n- Fun time overall with the wife.\",\n",
       " u'Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.',\n",
       " u'Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven\\'t been to this Dave and Buster\\'s since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn\\'t ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here\\'s where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she\\'d come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn\\'t came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he\\'s really busy right now. I doubt he\\'ll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that\\'s one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn\\'t even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!',\n",
       " u'This place just plain sucks\\nBad management lost them biz\\nDumb arcade drama*\\n\\n* they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old',\n",
       " u\"First time at Dave & Buster's and although I didn't go for the games, I was slightly disappointed. I went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks. The service was slow but the food was decent. The portions were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain.       \\n\\nWe went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kids there on a Friday night. I do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9.\",\n",
       " u\"DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat, have fun and drink!!  All ages can enjoy this place.  I was so EXCITED to hear them announce that after 10p, all children whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go!  It made for a nice evening for adults only.  \\n\\nEverytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves.  I didn't give it FOUR STARS because every time I've went I haven't been able to eat in the restaurant area of there.  I know I still get the same food that everyone else does wherever you sit.  Sometimes, I like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant.  I haven't as of yet, been seated there.  \\n\\nNot to mention that the servers around the bar, are a little slow at responding to customers as well.  So all in all, D&B's is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment.  Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area.\",\n",
       " u'Was impressed by the new menu and new decor.   Our waitress was nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  However, the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  There was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). My family and I were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  Kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight.',\n",
       " u\"Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.\",\n",
       " u'A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game ,ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4',\n",
       " u'Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service',\n",
       " u\"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!\",\n",
       " u\"Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back.\",\n",
       " u'ehh, 3.5 -- I can\\'t rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I\\'ve been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \\n\\nI\\'m a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It\\'s hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\\n\\nThe food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I\\'ve had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It\\'s your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\\n\\nDrinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn\\'t really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I\\'d go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I\\'ve never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \\n\\nThe prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it\\'s cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a fun time but can be pricey. It\\'s best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \\n\\nI can\\'t lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.',\n",
       " u'Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\\n\\nThe main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We\\'d never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\\n\\nYour visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You\\'ll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you\\'ll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\\n\\nThe staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \\n\\nNote the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That\\'s typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we\\'re courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \\n\\nAlso note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You\\'re supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I\\'ve seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One\\'s). \\n\\nThe thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it\\'s all families and Friday and Saturday night it\\'s all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that\\'s why the reviews are all over the place.\\n\\nThis review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\\n\\nUsing survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you\\'ll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\\n\\nI really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there.',\n",
       " u\"I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price!\",\n",
       " u\"There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed\",\n",
       " u\"My wife and I went here around 10pm on a Saturday night. The food was not spectacular, about the same quality that you'd get at an Applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  My steak was tough, but my wife enjoyed hers. Staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar), and had to wait awhile for a server. Food was prompt.\",\n",
       " u\"After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \\n\\nAnyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \\n\\nI had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event.\",\n",
       " u'Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\\n\\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn\\'t really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \\n\\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn\\'t ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\\n\\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \\n\\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \\n\\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \\n\\nIt\\'s a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.',\n",
       " u\"Its fun, but much smaller than some of the others I've visited.  Its clean, staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie. They do have good  food. Gets a 3 stars because I get bored easily at this location.\",\n",
       " u'I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can\\'t even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.',\n",
       " u\"I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat.\",\n",
       " u\"I recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kids to celebrate her daughters 21's birthday. I ordered the fish and chips. Don't order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months. I know I probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 times. The outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste. The fish itself was bland. After a few bites I called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise. He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite. The manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area. I was thinking he would have stopped but didn't oh well. The waiter took my meal it off the bill. I have eaten there before and the food was good. Sometime you just get one that isn't.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you\\'re lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \\nIn regards to the games, there\\'s a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I\\'ve gone I\\'ve gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it\\'s a really fun place that you\\'ll most certainly have a good time at.',\n",
       " u\"First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to!\",\n",
       " u'My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced.',\n",
       " u\"We checked in at 7:00 pm on a Saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering.  We were originally told 9:00 pm is when we'd be seated, but that's not the problem, because we were able to play before being seated.  We ACTUALLY didn't get seated until 10:00 pm, only to be told the kitchen was taking 3 hours for people's orders.  Didn't see a manager until after 10:30 pm.  Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat and went elsewhere.\",\n",
       " u'Ok, we went on a sat night with a large party, 2 hour wait for a table. Fine that\\'s understand then it turned to a three hour wait. Once seated we were told the kitchen was THREE HOURS behind and the wait for food would be three hours. The manger blamed us saying \" you came with a large party on a sat night, if you only order apps and not separate  meals, you MIGHT get food in 45 min\" really ? It\\'s the customers fault your staff can\\'t handle a sat night rush. The table of 5 next to us waited 3 hours for food, when they got it it was the WRONG food... I will never spend money here again!!!\\nTo top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there was pee everywhere!',\n",
       " u\"This is a really fun way to spend an afternoon. After several visits here, I've found a couple games that are easy to win and score you lots of tickets, and others that are just a blast to play. We did really awesome last time we were here, and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff. \\n\\nTheir food is not too bad. I've only ever eaten here once, and it wasn't that memorable, but I didn't hate it. I did like that they have a bar, and they had my favorite beer on tap, that was nice. \\n\\nLike pretty much any arcade I've ever been to, there are things that are a rip off, and occasionally something won't work properly. That really irritates some people but I figure no arcade is perfect. At least none that I've ever been to. The most irritating thing for me is that some of the games have a call button on them that signals an employee to come assist you, and I kept hitting the button with my leg or something, so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if I needed help, and I would be really confused. haha. \\n\\nWe went here with my husband's family on Thanksgiving, and we had a total blast. The whole place was pretty empty, and I felt really bad for the employees that had to work that day, but it was nice for us!\",\n",
       " u'Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged. Really. The only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took AMAZING care of us......',\n",
       " u'Chilling with Kimberly Vasil, Mikey & Big Bob for the 96.1 Kiss FM Listener Appreciation Party.  Kiss really knows how to throw a bash- $10 power cards, free t-shirts, megaphones & basketballs, appetizers & n/a beverages...  Apps are flowing & delicious, everybody is happy...  Nice Bash Kiss FM...!',\n",
       " u\"4 Stars for the fun factory, games, and all around experience, but 2 stars for the disgusting food and horrible service!\\n\\nI was SO excited to come here for my boyfriends birthday. Its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friends/family. We decided to eat here before we played. I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn't be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up. \\n\\nFirst off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn't finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration! \\n\\nI guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets. Everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. Overall it was still fun, and I am sure I will be back to play some more games!\",\n",
       " u\"The service at the Pittsburgh location was so incredible awful that I actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed I was, which I have never done before. It was a Saturday night and as someone who works in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it comes to service. We sat at the high tables in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minutes. I personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like I was stupid (maybe because im 17?) Also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eyes out because she told her server of an egg allergy she has and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg. Last I overhead they are heading to the hospital. I'm not writing this message to be spiteful, I'm writing it in hopes that the future of your restaurant will improve. There's a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both. My best wishing for improvement\",\n",
       " u\"Can we get a maintenance man?  And a janitor?  And a manager?   No?  Ok...\\n\\nI had a good time at Dave and Buster's, but that was based mainly on the company I kept and not the venue.   We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.   \\n\\nAll but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).   \\n\\nAnd we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).\\n\\nOverall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure.\",\n",
       " u\"Over priced, over hyped but a hell of a time regardless.  I think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friends over and have the same experience without the price and glitz.  I've yet to eat something here that impressed me.  The arcade is a bit dated but I like playing the big trivia game more than anything (again, you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit).  The new TV set up is pretty cool, but Dave and Busters is just what it is, an adult Chuckie Cheese not worth more than a visit a year, if that.\",\n",
       " u\"I've probably only been to 3 Dave & Buster's in my life, but this is probably my favorite one. It's a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 I've been to, though they pretty much have the same games. The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too. Definitely take advantage of the half priced games on Wednesdays!!!\\n\\nI don't come for the food, since it's very average. With all these good restaurants close by, why don't just eat somewhere else and come for the games?\",\n",
       " u\"Fell asleep last night before I got a chance to do my review this place is pretty cool it's just an arcade with a bunch of games they have a bar & u can order food as well the prizes have gotten better however there a few games that weren't working\",\n",
       " u'I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more.',\n",
       " u\"Wednesday's are half off game night. Menu includes some meals that also provide ten dollar game cards. It's loud and crazy but that's what is to be expected. The kids love this place. It's ok. Not my thing but I understand the fascination.\",\n",
       " u'im a fan\\n\\nI went to this one October 2014. I was in town for my favorite nfl team the colts steelers game. I went to the game and had fun in the city.\\n\\nI went on half off Wednesday. I really had fun with the games. im a young man and I like old Nintendo games. I like all kinds of games. the skee ball game acted up.\\n\\nI had fun\\n\\nI will go back. not to this one because of the miles to far I will go to the ohio one.\\n\\nim a fan',\n",
       " u'Great games and prizes. Amazing food.great way to enjoy your day with your family!!! Super busy place.',\n",
       " u\"I ate here for lunch today with my wife and 2 kids. Server was prompt getting to the table, took our order and then disappeared. Our food took 25 minutes yet there was only 4 table with people who were dining. Grilled cheese, salad and a quesadilla shouldn't take that long. Games were fine. Mens room didn't have any paper towels to dry hands with. Huge fail for this type of venue.\",\n",
       " u'I have been to Dave and Busters multiple times and i feel its a 2 star place.\\n\\nI can say the food quality is sub par.  In my opinion the food prices are expensive for what it is and quality.  They do offer a nice bar,but then again the prices in my opinion are a little higher.  Service isn\\'t too bad, but could be better.\\n\\nD&B is a great place for adults for sure, but the prices for tokes or \"game play\" is a little ridiculous.  Some games charge 6.9 credits to place.  Thats almost saying $1.50 a game and some of those games are addicting where I know most of us keep playing.  \\n\\nI also thing D&B isn\\'t the cleanest place either.  The bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion.  Doesn\\'t seem like they keep up with it.  To me, thats a big factor in rating restaurants.   \\n\\nAll in all, D&B is an ok place to visit, but not a place i would frequently waste my money.',\n",
       " u'We had our reunion banquet last weekend at this D&B. It was the highlight of our gathering. The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.\\n\\nKids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.',\n",
       " u\"This wasn't the cleanest place. Dirty paper towels all over the women's bathroom. No changing covers on the changing tables to change your Babies. Very disappointed when I came here compared to the other two I've been too. Also they aren't following corporate policy. Which ok, but when I asked about it to one of the managers on the way out, he said he didn't honor the first responders discount like the other stores do. Which ok Is fine, but he had a very sore attitude towards them. Very disappointed in his attitude more then anything.\",\n",
       " u\"I gave D&B 4 stars because our waiter was very geniune and nice! The place has definitely changed over the years, becoming a very pricey venue. The food was mediocre. The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers.\",\n",
       " u\"Had an awesome time here with my hubby the food was amazing but the games cost so much an the prizes where ok but all in all a good time I'll be bring the kids with next time\",\n",
       " u\"The food here is awful.  I came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few places at the Waterfront.  We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.\\n\\nI only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.\\n\\nI was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks.\",\n",
       " u'The food was good but we Waited an hour for our drinks then 1.5 hours food then an hour for our bill. Won\\'t be back! Not busy at all so not sure what the problem was. I\\'d hate to be there when they are \"busy\".',\n",
       " u\"Worst service I've ever had! we waited for over an hour for our food. After the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food. And told us her help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got. We left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food. No apologies nothing. While sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well. They didn't even get their drinks.\\nI would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat. Drink play games fine. I will never order food there again.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to Dave and busters to eat.... NO FOOD. Went to Dave and busters to play.. NO GAMES. Then I thought I'd wet my whistle with a cool glass of H2O..they even RAN OUT OF WATER... Some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game tickets accusing me of cutting line. SUCH HOSTILITY. dave and busters? More like BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD. SMH\",\n",
       " u\"This is a place I'd go to just for the games. The food was bad. I had the chicken sliders and there was two pieces of wood in the sandwich which I found in my mouth. Granted the manager did take off the price of the sliders but everyone's fries were lukewarm. My sister got the chicken fingers and wow, there was zero flavor or seasoning on it. The bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky. The waitress was nice but overall i wouldn't dine here again.\",\n",
       " u\"I was sad to see of the bad reviews below because I love D&B. However, I was just there this weekend and has dinner then went to the midway. The food wasn't bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didn't really have a server, and there were a couple small errors with our order. The bathroom was a wreck, like always. The trash can is always full, floors filthy, and smells strongly of urine. Half of the games I played wouldn't read my card on the first try.\\n\\nBartenders were slow & didn't seem to care, except for the manager. \\n\\nI'll be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating.\",\n",
       " u'If you are under 21 you must be accompanied by a 25 year old. Not only is this a stupid rule, but the staff rudely expressed this and smirked at us because we were under 21. Awful place with rude people.',\n",
       " u'I made the mistake of selecting this place to meet up with my family who were visiting from Florida.  Waited at bar for 20 minutes before be able to order a drink even though there were only 3 other people at the bar. Once the bartender did decide to wait on me, he was very short \"What will you have?\" and proceeded to give me a a receipt for the amount due before I could order 6 more drinks for the rest of our party??? We eventually left that bar after no one returned to our group sitting at the bar for the following 25 minutes. \\n\\nWe then moved onto the restaurant where we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Food was pretty good.\\n\\nMoved onto gaming area where approximately 1 out of 5 games were not operating properly. This place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years. We will NOT be going back!',\n",
       " u\"If you are here to just play games, then its a great deal of fun, and is also a fantastic place to catch a sporting event. \\n\\nIf you are here to eat, maybe try somewhere else. I have tried eating here on several occasions and find that it is for the most part terrible. Nothing tastes like it is fresh at all. I would guess everything is delivered frozen and then either deep fried or heated in a microwave. I can't think of any meal I've ever finished here either from being bland or just plain lousy. Even my 11 year old, who loves wings and chicken fingers (2 staples here) thinks the food is terrible and refuses to eat here, even though he loves to play the games. \\n\\nMy advice, eat somewhere else then head here to play.\",\n",
       " u\"4pm on a Friday afternoon and I got turned away for being 8 days under 21 I had no intention drinking and there was all of 4 people in the place even if I was 21 I would go to rivers downtown it's not like they can put a wristband saying I'm 20 or anything.\",\n",
       " u\"worst service wver i asked for someone to come over 3 times and we sat at a table for 20 minutes while a whole swarm of servers were just walking around passing us. not to mention alllll the tables in the whole game room were dirty. even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us. drinks took forever too and it wasnt busy at all the bartenders didn't care much they stood there for awhile. we will still go here just not try to eat. they need some structure in the work atmosphere.\",\n",
       " u'My sisters and I have always gone here together by ourselves. I am 18 and my sisters are younger than I am. As we walked in, they would not let us go in unless we were all 21, if we were not 21 we had to be with someone 25. \\nI called the manager & he told me that it has always been a rule, even though the website says 18. Which I was, and I was not allowed in. The manager ended up hanging up on me. \\nThey have turned something for teenagers into a place for adults. \\nI am extremely disappointed in how the staff and manager delt with this and will not return to this specific Dave n Busters.',\n",
       " u\"Had fun playing games and drinking here! Lots of games and prizes. Great atmosphere including a DJ! \\nOn a side note, some creepy middle aged man came up to me and my wife asking if he gets us a certain amount of tickets on a game (which we had to pay for) then we buy him an alcoholic beverage. What in the world is wrong with this man?!?! Couldn't find any management workers to advise so we just walked away and avoided him for the rest of the night.\",\n",
       " u\"Games are okay. However, this place is highly unhygienic. they don't clean any silverwares, plates etc. Avoid eating or drinking anything here.\",\n",
       " u\"The service was terrible. Games are games at any Dave & busters but service makes or breaks this place. I understand it was busy tonight because of the fight, but that's no excuse for rude employees... Especially multiple employees, hostesses, waitresses, and bus boys. The manager on the other hand was great and gave us a very reasonable explanation for a server being very rude. Either way, on a Saturday night, I wouldn't recommend going here.\",\n",
       " u\"We do not generally come here, as it is somewhat of a hike from our home, but we decided to wander out this way today. Last time we were here, we were not pleased, but today, we had a much better experience. \\n\\nThey had a ton of new games, which is a bonus! All of them were working too.....double bonus! I think they are a bit expensive, but it was a treat to go, so we didn't mind spending a couple of extra bucks.\\n\\nAfter playing out the credits on our card, we decided to have a late lunch. The menu is quite large, but has a great selection. Our server, Kiara, was wonderful! You could tell she was stressed out from her day, but she was very pleasant. We are pretty easy to take care of and you could almost hear the sigh of relief she gave when we told her to take her time and were ready to order when she was able to make it back from another table.\\n\\nThe restrooms were gross and the hostess stand was filled with confused girls who couldn't have cared less. The prize room was so empty of prizes, we decided to keep our points for our next visit.\\n\\nWe will be back, we will ask for Kiara to be our server, and hopefully we will be able to find prizes worth taking home!\",\n",
       " u'Nina the manager and Ashley the cashier extremely RUDE. refused to give me back change from kiosk malfunction. made me leave because I was with my girlfriend who was 20 and I was 23. supposed rule about someone under 21 needs to be with someone 25. rule is in about 3 size font. highly recommend that no one ever goes here.',\n",
       " u\"Worst service ever and all of our food was either cold or not what we ordered. Waited over a hour for our food as well. Our service was awful as well. Bathrooms were so disgusting and un-kept. I don't think I have one good thing to say about this place.\",\n",
       " u'Dave and Busters is a nice franchise to be able to enjoy arcade games for a more mature crowd. Defiantly enjoy coming here every time my friends and I do. \\n\\nCons: \\nFood - food isn\\'t very tasty, feels \"generic\" and not worth the $ listed for it. \\nBathroom - no, I don\\'t go out of my way to down star a place for their bathrooms but this is ridiculous. Toilet paper everywhere, sinks/floor covered in water, and no paper towels? \\n\\nPros:\\nAtmosphere - nice place to come grab a drink, watch a sporting event, or meet new people. \\nGames - who doesn\\'t like game? They have a ton of variety from hoops to racing. Afterwards (if you\\'re lucky) you can redeem tokens at their reward store.',\n",
       " u'I\\'ve loved coming here since it first opened as part of the Waterfront shopping development, and I\\'m always up for a game of skee-ball!  The Pittsburgh D&B location is recently remodeled, so if you haven\\'t been there in a while, do yourself a favor and check it out.  They\\'ve expanded the dining areas and added new, modern furniture, there are more TVs than you can shake a stick at, a menu with something for everyone, and of course... games!  They also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- Pittsburgh magician Lee Terbosic will be performing 2 shows every Friday and Saturday night.  You can even order drinks and food off the menu while you take in the show!\\n\\nI went to the opening show this past Friday night, and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a \"sno-cone\" (hint: this drink isn\\'t one for the kiddos!) to wash it down with.  Both were great -- the sno-cone flavors were just like an ICEE I would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad, but with that added kick of booze.  Hey, I\\'m not one to complain.  Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.  These were actually cooked into the fillings and I loved every bite.\\n\\nThe show itself was highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- Lee kept everyone on their toes for the entire 60 minutes.  I can\\'t wait to check out more shows here and flex my skee-ball arm!',\n",
       " u\"I know the reason for coming here is not the food, but this was ridiculous. \\n\\nThe five of us sat at one of the tables around the bar in the game room.\\n\\nWe still didn't have napkins or cutlery when our appetizer (nachos) came, and asked for some, please. She brought a pile of beverage napkins. When we pointed out the problem she went away and eventually came back with....more beverage napkins. It was a little messy, but we managed with our fingers.\\n\\nStill didn't have any cutlery or proper napkins when the food came. The woman that brought the food didn't think it was her job to get them for us, and we weren't going to eat salads and pasta with our fingers, so eventually we walked around to hunt up our waitress, who, fifteen minutes after the food, finally delivered the tools with which to eat it.\\n\\nThat was also our first opportunity to point out to her that one of us had ordered a salad, and had been delivered a pasta dish, completely unrelated, instead. Fifteen more minutes and she finally delivered the salad that had actually been ordered.\\n \\nBut that's not the worst. One of the pasta dishes that *had* been ordered arrived without any sauce, just the naked pasta. We don't know why. Despite pointing out the problem, she never did do anything about that. Maybe she thought it was easier to eat with your fingers that way.\\n\\nAnyway, don't try to eat here. Just come and play the games, but skip the food.\",\n",
       " u'I went to this establishment hoping for a fun time where i can leave my two children in the car and forget about my responsibilities for a few hours.  At first i enjoyed the freindly environment and enjoyed the attractive waitresses, however things went south fast there were children everywhere and i am not a nice person aroud children when i drink...lol. these kids hogged up everygame the entire night leaving me creating my own entertainment  which involved staring at there young moms and older sisters. I wish there were no kids. After a few hours and a 3 course meal i decided to make my own fun.  I kicked a child off a racing game chair and they precided to cry like a little girl.  She was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong. After a few choice words with management i will never go back there again and will only lock my kids inside of my car somewhere more adult like seabase.',\n",
       " u\"How ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids. I drove 40 minutes to take my younger brother to Dave and Busters for a fun afternoon but we were denied. Their policy states anybody under the age of 21 must be accompanied by an adult over the age of 25. I'm 22 years old and I don't understand why I can't bring my 12 year old brother to play games. We've gone many times a year for the past 15 years. After todays experience, I will not be going back, whether I am with kids or not.\",\n",
       " u\"If they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating. 2.5 hour wait and then cold food served. Did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates. Bathrooms atrocious. Nothing positive to say other than don't go there.\",\n",
       " u\"Ghetto, the server kept calling me baby all night. Staff is rude. Half the games don't work. The food is the only good thing this place has because it's somewhat unique. I did a survey that was on my receipt and gave my negative experience and it said a a manger would be in touch based on my answers and it's been a week and no call. What a joke.\",\n",
       " u'So I\\'ve been coming here for quite a well, and I\\'ve always been a fan. Upon entering the restaurant at 6pm on a Friday, our IDs were checked. You have to have at least one person who is 21+ to be seated---this is odd but okay. While we\\'re looking at the menu, a man shows up out of nowhere with a camera asking to take our picture for a keychain--it\\'s free but he\\'s \"working for tips\". Other than these two odd happenings, the meal was great. I ordered the Fire-Grilled Salmon and it\\'s one of the best salmon dinners I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ll definitely return again for games and drinks.',\n",
       " u\"Apparently it's socially unacceptable to continue going to Chuck E. Cheese after you've reached puberty. This I learned the hard way. Fortunately, the geniuses behind Dave & Busters got my back. Sometimes I just need to escape the stress of adulthood with a few rounds of skee-ball (don't judge me). I can work with the amount and variety of games, but it could definitely be better. I would suggest coming in on Wednesdays for half-price games to get more bang for your buck!\\n\\nBe aware of the obnoxious guests. I expect children to be a bit rowdy, but even some adults suddenly forget all socially acceptable behavior once you throw them in the arcade. \\n\\nI come to D&B for the games and not the food. Aside from the horrible customer service I've experienced, their food also tastes generic and mediocre.  For the prices they're charging, it is not worth it. Save a few bucks and find a better meal elsewhere.\",\n",
       " u\"Came here for my son's birthday. Waited 20 minutes for our drinks and an additional 49 minutes for our food. The waitstaff really didn't appreciate having to take breaks from their cellphones to seat/serve us. Had to ask over and over for drinks, water, silverware....etc. I could understand if they were busy, but it wasn't at all. \\n\\nI ordered the sirloin, which was poorly kept/cooked. The food wasn't very good at all. \\n\\nGames were fun...as always. Eat before you come to play!\",\n",
       " u\"You're either going to have the best service of your life or you're going to sit at the bar for an hour waiting for your quesadilla to come out. There is no in between yet 4,000 tickets later I still come back. I see no fun in the casino so Dave and Busters is my adult casino that still makes me nostalgic about my childhood. I enjoy the hoops game,  the top 40 music,  the yummy eats and most of their cocktail menu is pretty darn impressive. I always go for the Passion Fruit Sangria or the Backwoods lemonade that comes with a shot in a mini Solo Cup. They can be pricey after a while that's why I show up for happy hour. If you're into gaming do show up on a Wednesday where all games are half off.\",\n",
       " u\"Went here with friends on a Saturday afternoon...the dining area was not busy at all...though you'd have thought by the service it was packed full....it took forever for our drinks to come out (which are WAY overpriced)...the food is very sub par for the price, would've been better off eating before we went to play..my entree came out, plate hot, food completely cold. I've never sent back food, EVER, but this was ridiculous. The server takes my plate, and says they would make it right. I did NOT receive a fresh entree, it was put in the microwave and sent back to me. How do I know? The bread and meat in the sandwich was still torn apart, which I did while checking my food the first time to see if it was warm inside. They did however take it off my check, but never giving me a menu or asking me if I'd like to order something else, so my friends at the table gave me leftover ribs and fries off their plates. By the time the server came back so I COULD ask for something else, the table was already done eating, so I just sucked it up and when went on our way to play the arcade.  I highly recommend eating somewhere GOOD, and then just go to D&B to play. \\n*waitress sucked \\n*overpriced food and drinks\\n*very average food quality, though lots of menu choices\\n*arcade was fun!\\n*nice location, easy to get to\",\n",
       " u\"Despite asking specifically for an appointment at the Peter's Township office, they scheduled the visit for Bethel Park which only has physician's assistants, not doctors.  Was then told that they don't have any opening so it was Bethel Park or nothing.  Can't say much for an office that is managed this way.  The lack of empathy was even more disturbing.\",\n",
       " u\"The doctors were knowledgeable but the staff at the call center was rude and not accommodating. It was also not convenient to get an appointment. I waited an hour and a half to be seen when I was the only patient in the office. The drug reps came with food so I guess patients don't matter.\",\n",

The staff from this practice repeatedly called my cell phone over the course is a week to ask for this person, even after I told them each time that they had the wrong number and tried to clear it up.  Worse yet, when I POLITELY told the staff member each time about the problem, they RUDELY slammed the phone down and hung up.  The staff at this practice needs a lesson in professionalism and courtesy, and needs to mark their file to indicate that they have a wrong number listed.  Don't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling.\",\n",

I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.\\n\\nThe employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.\\n\\nThe only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back.\",\n",

So, its Friday night, 5pm....yeah right...who's gonna even bother answering?  These guys did.  Ed was here in about an hour.  He was very professional (he even put booties on his feet before coming into the house), explained exactly what he was doing and described what the problem was and how to prevent it from happening in the future.  And guess what!  He CLEANS TOO!  Now, back to my laundry....what a way to spend a Friday night.\",\n",

I\\'ve had way too many \"oh shit\" moments like these this summer. This time, the saddle valve connection for my ice maker burst. Thank you again to Rdn Plumbing for rescuing me and installing the proper type of valve. As always, you guys were prompt and professional. :)',\n",

So far, so good, right?  Even though RDN had to go back to the shop to get the correct part he came right back. Job well done. The next morning the water dispenser was only giving us a small trickle so I called for help again.  RDN was here in fifteen minutes. The installer had not blown air out of the filter first. RDN  did it.\\nKudos for great, caring service.',\n",

       " u'We used rdn plumbing who was recommended by aha (american home shield) to help fix a clogged drain.  A guy named Justin came and helped us.  After he left the drain was unclogged but the pipe below the sink was leaking.  We left the country for vacation and have been swamped in construction afterwards.  We called aha for a recall to have rdn come back and fix the leaking pipe. I woke up at 830 am to justin screaming (and i mean screaming so loud that i was alarmed in bed with earplugs in).  He was questioning my husband about why we waited 3-4 weeks to call it in.  After my husbad explained that we were out of the country he implied thAtmy husband messed with the pipes himself.  My husband stayed calm and told him that he just needs to fix the problem from not putting pipes back together correctly.  THEN my husband askd if he could call aha and see if the leaking faucet would be covered.  He went out to his truck and called and then came barging back in with a wrench and started fixing the faucet by literally turning the wrench twice.  He told my husband while turning the wrench that it wasnt covered.  My husband tried to get im to stop because he only wanted to know if it was covered.  Justin freaked out again and wrote up a whole new work order.  He gave us the bill and stormed off.  The even wrote on the statement \"i am not going to be told how to do my job\".  I have never seen a temper tantrum from a so called professional in my life.  I als would like to add that i have NEVER left a 1/5 stars for any service professional and we are no strangers to house remodeing.',\n",
       " u\"Hot water tank burst in the middle of a shower, had to go to work shortly after. Got to work frustrated knowing this is really going to cost me. Remembered I had a home warranty and I called them up to see what kind of situation I'm really in, they said no issue and contracted RDN to me. Nick? I believe it was arrived promptly this morning from RDN, was extremely professional and was more than generous with information regarding the draining of the tank on a bi-yearly basis (something of which I did not know to do). He was polite and cleaned up after himself. They alleviated my issue and made me very happy. They're a little out of my range for basic needs as I live roughly 40 minutes from Homestead but I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone. Awesome folks.\",\n",

Ed from RND arrived promptly, introduced himself, asked us a few questions and got right to work. He had to leave to purchase the new tank and came back in a timely manner. He was very careful not to dirty our carpeting when taking out the old tank. Ed was very professional, friendly and he helped to put my mind at ease during a stressful morning. He explained how to maintain the new tank to make it last longer. I highly recommend RND Plumbing and Their technician Ed! He certainly exceeded our expectations!!',\n",

Waited another 20min we live about 1.5 miles away from the place still nothing. So we called back and asked for our money back. They never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter. And oh since we used a card it's going to be 3-4 days to see the refund.

       " u\"SUMMARY:\\nIf I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\\n\\nGOOD:\\n- Decent beer...\\n- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\\n- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\\n- Amusing name.\\n\\nBAD:\\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\\n- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\\n\\nCome if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.\",\n",
       " u\"I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.\\nThere are several dishes that are MONEY.\\nAppetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip\\nEntree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.\\nDesert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)\\nBar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  \\nHalf the menu is really good, the other half is great.  \\nThe beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.\\nHead over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.\\nI used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.\\nDon't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.\",\n",
       " u\"I thought this place was pretty decent. My friend and I were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads... and they were HUGE. and tasty. I liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing. My friend's was even more slathered so she didn't dig it too much. We'd also ordered chips with guacamole, the guac was pretty good. my friend enjoyed her beer. I enjoyed my coke (I know, I'm lame).\\n\\nso yeah... wasn't bad, wasnt the best, but it was okay.\",\n",
       " u'Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they\\'re better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.

       " u\"My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.\",\n",
       " u\"everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and i've never been dissappointed.  i sit in the bar, grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos.  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens.  rock bottom is a chain but it's one of the better chains in the area.  i'll pass on chili's or friday's and come to rock bottom instead.  oh and typically i walk over to target - work off some of those nachos.\",\n",

My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.\\n\\nWe started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  \\n\\nHe got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.\\n\\nWe are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\\n\\nOur food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)\",\n",
       " u\"This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here.\",\n",
       " u\"Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.

       " u\"Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.\",\n",
       " u'Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious.',\n",
       " u\"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\\n\\nNow, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\\n\\nService was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\\n\\nBeer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\\n\\nI REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\\n\\nVerdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.\",\n",
       " u'Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. \\n\\nWell I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. \\n\\nPart of this is my fault...I always order \"healthy\" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn\\'t 5 star.  \\n\\nI started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don\\'t think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \\n\\nMy friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\\n\\nPros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\\n\\nCons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can\\'t always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.',\n",
       " u\"Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.

Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\\n\\nThe brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier.\",\n",
       " u\"Here's the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  Stick with the sandwiches, salads, burgers, and bar food; and you'll be OK.  I've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  Also, I've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.

       " u\"Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. \\n\\n\\nDepending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! \\n\\n\\nThe bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \\n\\nOn Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials. \\n\\nhttp://www.rockbottom.com/MC \\n\\nNeedless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL! \\n\\nNow everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom's Beers! \\nThe in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA's, Rotating Darks and Kolsch. \\n\\nStop by on Thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!\",\n",

There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. \\n\\nWhat really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them.

Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! \\n\\nAnother favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it\\'s big enough for two people. \\n\\nThe service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. \\n\\nA truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! \\n\\nCome to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!',\n",
       " u\"Rock Bottom on Thursday nights is the place to be. Team Trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. The DJ (Todd) is great. \\n\\nThe food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. \\n\\nOn nights that are not trivia nights, Rock Bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. Larger parties will usually be split into two tables. \\n\\nOverall, an enjoyable place at which I am a regular.\",\n",
       " u\"So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. \\n\\nFirst surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. \\n\\nService was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work.\",\n",
       " u\"The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\\n\\nAs others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!\",\n",
       " u\"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \\n\\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \\n\\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \\n\\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!\",\n",
       " u'I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\\n\\nThe hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn\\'t go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can\\'t-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\\n\\nHub ordered a Reuben - why, I\\'ll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn\\'t have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\\n\\nThe tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn\\'t have been worth the experience.  We\\'ll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we\\'ll head somewhere else afterwards.',\n",
       " u'I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \"brewery\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It\\'s a chain.  Whomp whomp!',\n",
       " u'For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.',\n",
       " u'Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good.',\n",
       " u'I\\'ve always been pleasantly surprised with the food I\\'ve gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised\\' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I\\'ve really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don\\'t get anything above and beyond this place\\'s call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I\\'ll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn\\'t count.....).\\n\\nBut besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I\\'ve recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I\\'ve also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It\\'s an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I\\'m a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\\n\\nI\\'ve always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\\n\\nI definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more.',\n",
       " u'I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn\\'t good and the food is average, at best.\\n\\nIt was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they\\'d have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn\\'t work either. If we hadn\\'t REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would\\'ve just left. It definitely wasn\\'t busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can\\'t overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\\n\\nCombine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that\\'s kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.',\n",
       " u'Happy hour at Rock Bottom, 2 thumbs up!  Good prices, the pizza is delicious, drinks are a few dollars off the regular price, good service, and the atmosphere is always casual and fun.',\n",
       " u'The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \"eh\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn\\'t text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas.',\n",
       " u'Watch the fat girls in here. They will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he goes to the bathroom & then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w/ in ear shot. Everything else including the burger & beers I devoured was excellent.',\n",
       " u'Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \\nI vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works.',\n",
       " u'I haven\\'t been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it\\'s been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \\n\\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn\\'t, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \\n\\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\\n\\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That\\'s the empty price.  To me, that\\'s a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won\\'t deter me from returning.',\n",
       " u\"I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer, and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got.  Though I couldn't find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section, there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot.  The atmosphere of this seems pretty cool, especially in the pub area.\",\n",
       " u'Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!!',\n",
       " u\"I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey. The cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. The star of the night was the appetizer, the artichoke and crab dip. It was awesome. My only complaint was I ordered a Red Ale and they were out. I had the Curmudgeon instead and it was very good, but still.\",\n",
       " u'Slow service\\nBelow average food \\nIll pass',\n",
       " u\"First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing.\",\n",
       " u'Thanks to the staff here\\nFor being so friendly and\\nCool with our whole mess*\\n\\n*rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us',\n",
       " u\"Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time.\",\n",
       " u\"Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! \\n\\nMondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \\n\\nThe prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \\n\\nI felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour.\",\n",
       " u'Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \\n\\nTheir food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren\\'t anything to write home about.\\n\\nI feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili\\'s of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!',\n",
       " u\"Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\\n\\nOur waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\\n\\nHere's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \\n\\nAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\\n \\nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\\n\\nFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed.\",\n",
       " u'Mostly come here for the beer and sports. Fun place!',\n",
       " u\"Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \\n\\nThis was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\\n\\nMy wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\\n\\nWe started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\\n\\nMy wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\\n\\nOur daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\\n\\nI ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \\n\\nThe kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\\n\\nOn a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else.\",\n",
       " u\"I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\\n\\nAlso, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!\",\n",
       " u'Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews!',\n",
       " u\"I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety, and everything I've tried has been good.  Portions are large.  \\n\\nOne side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.  \\n\\nI love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by.\",\n",
       " u\"Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.\",\n",
       " u'Normally the food is outstanding, no more salted bread sticks, but they did bring back the ball park pretzels.  Not very good, cool to low warm. Hard, dense.  Mango ice tea is wonderful.\\n\\nWill see how the chicken comes out.\\n\\nTo be continued...',\n",
       " u\"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\\n\\nWe walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\\n\\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\\n\\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \\n\\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\\n\\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\\n\\nOverall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...\",\n",
       " u\"I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. \\nI think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless.\",\n",
       " u\"The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA. It may be a chain but I always get that microbrew restaurant feel when I'm here. They could upgrade the quality of the servers but I've never had a really bad experience with the service.\",\n",
       " u'I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.',\n",
       " u\"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \\n\\nSo finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\\n\\nThe service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\\n\\nThe husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \\n\\nFurthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...\",\n",
       " u'the food was delicious. portion size generous. atmosphere good. Our waitress Lindy was outstanding. Have nothing but good things to say. Would highly recommend to everyone !',\n",
       " u\"Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.\",\n",
       " u\"I have to say that I've only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I've had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail, I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again!\",\n",
       " u'My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat.',\n",
       " u'Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\\n\\nOn to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic.',\n",
       " u\"On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  \\n\\nThe rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure.\",\n",
       " u\"Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!\",\n",
       " u\"I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!\",\n",

       " u'The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times.',\n",
       " u\"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\\n\\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.\",\n",
       " u\"I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. \\n\\nMy friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there. \\n\\nWe've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good. \\n\\nI'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back.\",\n",
       " u\"Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \\n\\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\\n\\nMy only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \\n\\nOverall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!\",\n",
       " u\"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\\xf6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.\",\n",
       " u'The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I\\'ve tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \"foodie\" palate, don\\'t even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it.',\n",
       " u\"This place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables, which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. \\n\\nI ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them. \\n\\nIt was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area.\",\n",
       " u\"I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \\n\\nTheir beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \\n\\nAs far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \\n\\nAlmost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \\n\\nAnother item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \\n\\nThey also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \\n\\nTheir side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \\n\\nI usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. \\n\\nService is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !\",\n",
       " u\"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.\",\n",
       " u\"I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \\n\\nI prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \\n\\nNachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. \\n\\nThis is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. \\n\\nThey have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \\n\\nService is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.\",\n",
       " u'This is  a \"Okay\" place to eat.  The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  Rice (Cajun Taco) was not cooked well.  Would I go there again \"maybe\".  If your into beer and watching the game, then yeah go there.',\n",
       " u'BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. \\n\\nI came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape\\xf1o cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work.',\n",
       " u'We have been going to Rock Bottom for sevesrl years and Love it! It is our go to place, when we want a nice meal, in a nice atmosphere,  with good service! We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious! Our server was very attentive and social. As usual, a save by our go to place! I know we will retun here again!',\n",
       " u\"My husband and I went to Rock Bottom Brewery last night for the first time and we had a WONDERFUL experience! Our server, Amanda, was very attentive, and was able to make several good beer recommendations to my husband. My husband said that his burger was the best one he'd ever had, and my pizza was delicious! Prices weren't too bad either, especially considering how amazing the food and the service was. Rock Bottom is now on our list of favorite local restaurants and we will definitely be visiting it again in the future!\",\n",
       " u\"Nice enough chain restaurant.  Have ordered the fish tacos appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish tacos which comes with black beans and rice.  Both are ok, though I think I'd order something else next time as I'm pretty picky about fish tacos.  \\n\\nThe appetizer tacos were rather dry.  The cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly.  They come in 2 shells -- an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell.  Why might I ask?  Why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesn't add to the dish in any way.  \\n\\nOh, well.  Can't speak about beer here as I'm not a beer drinker.\\n\\nThe space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasn't the quickest to come to our table even though it wasn't busy.\\n\\nWould I revisit?  Probably; it was decent enough with many other menu options.  Keep in mind, however, that there are many options nearby worthy of a visit.\",\n",
       " u'Standard issue Rock Bottom.  We ordered the nachos....they could have easily served 6 people.  I have never seen a more massive platter of food.  Bar service was okay...guy working there was nice to talk to about sports.',\n",
       " u\"On a Friday I went to Rock Bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4-6. Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it's only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty.\",\n",
       " u\"For this occasion I was with my girls, we were looking for a place to have a good lunch.  We looked around and chose Rock Bottom, we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves.  The server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  She when over the specials and took our drink order.   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.\",\n",
       " u'Went to Rock Bottom at The Waterfront over the weekend with 10 adults and 3 children in high chairs. Service was good, efficient, and fast. I enjoyed a good bowl of tortilla soup and an order of Buffalo wings. Both very good. From the table, I heard rave reviews of the Ball Park Pretzel the other meals including a 2 alarm burger, a few classic burgers cooked medium as requested, mac n cheese, and lobster and shrimp enchiladas.  A very good experience.',\n",
       " u\"My visits here are generally pretty consistent.  I love getting the beer sampler even though I've drank all the beers twice over.  I wouldn't say I have a favorite dish here yet but the food was always generally good.  I guess one thing that sticks out is the chicken mac and cheese and the Reuben.  \\n\\nWhen I go here though, I'm going for the beer more than the food.  Definitely worth a trip for dinner.\",\n",
       " u\"First, I have to say that I've been here twice in the past few months, and each time was with a very large group (one group of 20, one group of over 30) on a weekend evening and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch.\\n\\nThat being said, the food and beer aint all that bad either! Fish & Chips, chicken mac'n cheese, salmon bites, guacamole and the Maker's Mark burger are all quite good, as are the beers (the K\\xf6lsch is my favorite!).\",\n",
       " u\"There are few local restaurants as popular as this place, the food is consistently good and the service always great. I meet people regularly at the bar, we usually have dinner but lately that's not always the case. The biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu items.\",\n",
       " u\"Overpriced. Food is OK, but way overpriced. Quantities are small....much smaller than the picture in the menu. The beer is average. But yes, you guessed it, that's overpriced too.\",\n",
       " u\"It's been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom, and while I still don't love the place they've definitely improved since then. They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.\\n\\nThat said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. \\n\\nI was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.\\n\\nAdd in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book.\",\n",
       " u\"Was hoping for a great end of a day experience, but...... Things happen. Waitress seemed to have forgotten about us, entrees came out prior to our appetizers. Entree of fish &chips was a major disappointment, fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainy.starters were comp'ed but I doubt we'd go back. Sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter. Two stars and that's it.\",\n",
       " u'Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper\\'s Tale.\\n\\nYou might say, \"I\\'ve never heard of Rock Bottom, there\\'s no way that they are a chain restaurant.\" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you\\'ll end up on the rock bottom.\\n\\nAfter a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn\\'t right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.\\n\\nWe waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. \\n\\nSo if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.',\n",
       " u\"Great bar. Great atmosphere. Great food. Cool place to be.\\n\\nDefinitely one of those places you could keep going back just because it's so chill and it's a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food. Nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds. Their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant, in my opinion. The nachos can be split among 4-5 people easy. Lots of toppings and yummy all around.\",\n",
       " u\"While this is certainly not my first meal at Rock Bottom, this is my first meal in a year or two . The wait was minuscule, and the greeter was pleasant. As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. \\n\\nI started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. \\n\\nThey say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  \\n\\nMy meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! \\n\\nThe final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. \\n\\nAs you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!\",\n",
       " u\"This is another one of my favorite places that had deteriorated dramatically. Corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck. The menu has gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entrees and a bunch of small plates that are ok but not great. The service has also suffered tremendously. We are abandoning this restaurant.\\n\\nI don't expect this Rock Bottom to be around too much longer.  In the past, on nights when the Pirates were playing out of town, the bar and the restaurant would be packed.  Last night, it was only slightly busy.  You can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the conditions of the bathroom.  The staff was overwhelmed and the bathrooms were filthy and in serious need of repairs.  Alas, I don't think that Rock Bottom will still be in business in six months.  Hopefully, if that happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House will find its way into Pittsburgh.\",\n",
       " u\"I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! \\n\\nI was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.\\n\\nEverything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.\\n\\nThe Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.\\n\\nIn the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. The bar tender was quick to get me a beer (the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good) but after that I was totally ignored. Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. I got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to Uno's. Glad I did... Got great service and my meal came quickly.\\n\\nVerdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if that's what you want but if you're hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table.\",\n",
       " u'For a chain, it is better atmosphere than you would expect.  The menu options all sound delicious, but the food quality is not great.  Just mediocre.',\n",
       " u'Service is good, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Beer and cocktails are good as well. Food...not so much.  My boyfriend and I shared the Jalapeno Pretzel appetizer which was pretty good, but our entrees.... disappointing.  I got the Baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger.   both were super dry. i could not even finish half of mine. He had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down. If i were to go back, it certainly would not be to eat.',\n",
       " u'Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling.  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  For a side,  I requested the seasonal veggies (trying to be healthier) and was told it\\'s a squash mixture - great I love summer squash!  \\n\\nI received a poorly seasoned burger. The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.\\n\\nOur server was nice.  The beer was simple.  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead, perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors.',\n",
       " u'Apps were good, service was average, and the certified angus beef tips were awful.  They were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor.  The picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tips.  However, I was given only 4 tips, which in the end I was thankful for, because if I had any more, I would have had to rest my jaw for a couple days due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tips.',\n",
       " u'Great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menus. They are also great at accommodating large groups and these are one of the few places that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot. Been here plenty of times with my group and we enjoyed it every time.',\n",

       " u\"I am a FAN of rock bottom.  This is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a FAN.  We went on a Saturday night after a day at sandcastle.  The wait was 45-60 mins for a table of 5 which was to be expected on a saturday evening. \\n\\nOur server wasn't the best in my opinion.  She was very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our orders in for our drinks, appetizers, and meals.  \\n\\nSince we were all hungry, I ordered us the nachos.  They were AWESOME.  Very happy and pleased with that selection. My sister ordered pretzels which were pretty good,but the clearly had TOO much salt on them.  The cheese dip that came with the pretzels however was AWESOME.  Definetly pleased with our selection.\\n\\nWe placed our order, which came out in a timely fashion.  Everyone was pleased.  The prices for the meal were about average for everything that you got.  I got the the margarita pizza which was pretty good.  My wife got jalpeno burger with fries.  My son got the kids pizza.  My sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe.  The best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here.  Everyone got a honey beer (can't remember the exact kind) but it was 7.75 for 25oz which was a fair price i think.  \\n\\nAll in all, its def a place worth going.\",\n",
       " u\"Good beer, food and service. Arrived on a Wednesday night for business and sat at the bar. Bartender was attentive and nice. Food was great. I had the Bison Prairie Burger. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great. I'll be coming here again on my next business trip.\",\n",
       " u\"The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. \\n\\nIf you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. \\n\\nEven though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick.\",\n",

       " u'They did a good job accommodating a large group. Mac N Cheese with chicken and bacon was good. In house beers were moderate and selection was limited. Good service, franchise-ish ambiance, nothing extraordinary but easy enough.',\n",
       " u\"Loved the American Blonde and gram's oat soda IPA.  Good service.    Egg rolls were very good.  Our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers.\",\n",
       " u\"If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option. They have a nice seasonal selection and it's all tap which I prefer. I also like that most of the seating is booth. On my visit the service was lack luster. I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired. I went with a beer sampler. It was nice being able to try everything they have. I of course went with the pumpkin beer. For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed. They had a great flavor. My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked. If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasn't the case on this particular visit.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!\",\n",
       " u'Came here on a Saturday night. Waited over an hour for a table for 2, but enjoyed some great beers from the bar while waiting. Ordered the calamari appetizer to start which was very good. My fish and chips entree was cold, but my boyfriends 2 am burger was phenomenal.',\n",
       " u'Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican and south of the border fare. I had the Beef Tip Sliders. What a ridicules offering. Each one (2 on a plate) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3\" bun. It was taken back to the kitchen, after I complained, and a thin sliver now appeared. The only thing good about this experience, the waiter was nice!\\nAs the raven said, \"Never, never more.\"',\n",
       " u'We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. \\nI had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. \\nI would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back.',\n",
       " u\"Great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones! You won't be disappointed. The Jalape\\xf1o pretzels are dope!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill. While my boyfriend and I use to really enjoy coming here, the food has gotten considerably worse. They've taken many things off the menu we use to enjoy, such as the pretzel sticks with beer cheese, and replaced them with frozen ballpark pretzels and nacho cheese. Tonight I ordered a steak salad, of which the steak was good, but there was nothing on the salad that was listed on the menu. Not to mention the whole place smells smells like dirty mop water. The beer is still very good, that's why still gave them 2 stars.\",\n",
       " u'We were a party of four. My wife and I ordered the stuffed pepper. It was very spicy with some serious zip. However, it was delicious. My youngest son had the chicken enchiladas. He thought that those were the best that he ever had. My oldest son had the chicken mac-n-cheese. He thought that it was very good. We all shared the calamari and jalapeno appetizer-- very spicy, but very good. We also had the buffalo wing appetizer. The sauce was very good, but the wings were OK. The brownie dessert was a little disappointing. The brownies were dry. I also had the key lime dessert. It was OK. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was vibrant and enjoyable. We will definitely return the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.',\n",
       " u'We stopped into Rock Bottom for a late dinner. The place was hopping-the bar side and the restaurant side. We chose to dine on the restaurant side. There were a lot of great choices on the menu. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. The chicken it self had a great grilled flavor. I think it was good enough to eat plain. The barbecue sauce was smokey with a hint of sweetness. The pickles added a tangyness. It was a huge sandwich. It was served with fries but they were a little soft. They needed a few more minutes of cooking. \\nI only ate half of my sandwich so I would have room for dessert. They have a couple of smaller desserts that are served in Mason jars. Then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people. I ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee. Yum!!!! It was the perfect ending to a good meal.',\n",
       " u\"Ergh, this place. I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.\\n\\nCame with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.\\n\\nIt started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.\\n\\nMy brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? \\n\\nAgain - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry. \\n\\nHonestly, if you come, come for drinks and a salad, they don't screw those up. Everything else, avoid.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been coming here a lot lately and the food is consistently good. Their burgers are great (especially the 2:00 am burger) and the staff is always friendly. I haven't tried too many of their beers but the food will keep me coming back!\",\n",
       " u\"Was only here for drinks so this is not a reflection on food. Tried their standard flight and greatly enjoyed the Xm@s but nothing else stood out. Also had the Gentleman, Holly's Mistletoe and Lively. The Gentleman was good in my opinion.  2 out of 8 beers impressed me and above standard for my tastes while the others were below standard when it comes to craft beers.  Again this is my opinion. I have a wide range of styles I enjoy but IPAs are a solid choice for me.  Pricing for flights was excellent at $6 for 6 4oz. tasters.\\n\\nThe service was lackluster. Myself and two friends were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that was with us and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything. She was a bit put off to say the least. We tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay was a bit awkward.  \\n\\nI hear the food is very good and will return to try it and adjust my review accordingly.\",\n",
       " u'A friend and I stopped in to Rock Bottom Brewery before a movie on a cold Thursday.  It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.  \\n\\nOur server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault. \\n\\nOverall, this was a positive experience.  It has a \"chain\" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.  But it is good food, good beer, good service, and a fair price.  Definitely.',\n",
       " u\"first bad experience at this place. double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make. I asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt. instead of caramelized onions, they added raw onions. they should check the quality of jalape\\xf1os they use, it was not hot at all. they also forgot to add mayo.\\nohh and they took 50 minutes to prepare this burger, and we missed our movie at amc. \\nthe waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay. won't visit again.\",\n",
       " u\"Saturday night, Valentine's Weekend around 7 pm - Larger tables sat quicker from what I could tell when we were waiting. I was with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minutes for a table. When we were finally sat it was by the door where it was really drafty. It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I'm itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I'm not a beer fan, but I really liked it. Our waitress was extremely nice as well. We were comped 20 something dollars when we didn't even complain or say anything. It was a nice surprise when we got our bill. I'll definitely be back.\",\n",
       " u\"The first time I experienced the Rock Bottom Brewery was in downtown Chicago. It was wonderful! I think I went back the next night because I had such a good experience. It's pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it's a great spot. \\n\\nThe Pittsburgh location doesn't quite compare. The actual layout, food, service, etc., is average. I ordered the bison burger last night and it was pretty good. But, it was a bit dry and it didn't seem like they put much effort into it. Honesty, when I received my food, it reminded me of being at a place like Applebee's of Chili's. They were out of Mac and cheese because they had had a busy night. I didn't mind that at all because I had tried the Mac and cheese before; you should give it a try if you haven't. \\n\\nThe waitress was great. She checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. The menu is large. You're sure to find something you want to try. But it's a brewery, so the options are mostly variations of bar foods. It's a cool place to go if you want to eat late and have a decent sized group with you.\",\n",
       " u'We waited for almost an hour, while groups smaller and larger, who had arrived both before and after us, streamed in and out. When we checked on our table status, they only replied \"You have 19 minutes\" to wait. I guess it didn\\'t matter that I could see tons of open tables if they have some sort of seating timer. Once we were seated, our waiter was quick but that\\'s just about the extent of anything nice I have to say. The other folks in our party mentioned that the burgers were pretty good; however, my Cuban Cristo was a mess. It had too much batter and was fried too long, resulting in a greasy, brick of a sandwich. And, for a brewery, I was extremely disappointed by the small size of their beer list. Overall, it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food. I won\\'t be going back.',\n",
       " u'Rock Bottom is a decent larger sports/brew pub seating is at a premium on weekend evenings, prepare to wait an hour to be seated at a table or try your luck scurrying against others as a high-top becomes available in the bar.\\n\\nThe food is average, nothing extraordinary...we did get the sausage filled pretzels bites, they had little or no  sausage in half of them (should have gotten the ball park pretzel)\\n\\nThey do offer a drink and wine selection but beer is limited to house brew only.',\n",
       " u\"We got here at the last minute last night before the kitchen closed, there were five of us, and we got right in and had awesome service. We tried two beer flights so we could have the entire beer menu. The flights are priced exceptionally well. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which were good but not the best I've ever had. I had the Brewer's Cobb, which has always been amazing at every Rock Bottom I've ever been to and an extraordinary amount. My husband had the beef tips, which tasted good but didn't have a lot of meat. It left him wanting more. The mashed potatoes and onion straws paired with the tips were good though. The atmosphere was great, it was clean, and our server was friendly and attentive. Very happy with the experience.\",\n",
       " u'I had my baby shower here. The space very nice, staff friendly, and everyone loved the food, especially the chicken Mac n cheese! Everyone is still raving about it!',\n",
       " u\"The experience was different the second time around. We asked for a booth and got one right away. When we sat down, the waitress came fast and serve our drinks and appetizers fast. The food was great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli. It was not good, the broccoli was burnt bad and I ask medium well and they sent it bloody. My boyfriend's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back. They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn't and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked. He apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave us fresh spinach dip, which I enjoyed. I will not return but the customer service was awesome and I won't say don't go, but know what to order and what to watch out for when ordering!\",\n",
       " u'Very disappointed with this place. A lot of people standing around, table and menus sticky, the food was FUCKED!! Sent my pathetic Bruschetta chicken back because it was the size of a chicken nugget with one giant stem of broccoli.  Do not come here to eat. \\n2 stars because the beer was good.',\n",
       " u'Although the proximity to my house adds convenience as a factor in going to Rock Bottom, the food is less than desirable. \\n\\nThe beer there is great, it\\'s a fairly clean establishment with a good wait staff, but the food IS AWFUL. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer, and for $10.59 I got 4 mini tortillas, not toasted at all, with some melted cheese and chicken. No salsa, no lettuce, guac, sour cream.  NOTHING. \\n\\nThen I was hoping the pizza I ordered would sort of redeem our experience, I got their \"hot\" style pizza since I like spicy food. The small pizza probably had 8 jalape\\xf1os worth of peppers, and then some sauce and cheese. It was so underwhelming. I wish the food could match the quality of their beer. Real bummer.',\n",
       " u\"My husband and I were fans of the Denver Rock Bottom when we lived in Colorado, so we decided to have a date night at the Pittsburgh location a few weeks ago.\\n\\nThey were very crowded, but we got a reservation on OpenTable and were able to skip the line.  We arrived a few minutes early, but they were able to seat us when we got there.  \\n\\nThe beer is consistently good here--  I went with the fire chief red ale, and my husband tried both one of the cask strength beers and an IPA.  I ordered the bacon chicken mac n' cheese, and it was as good as I remembered.  My husband's steak was overdone, but the servers were very apologetic (they offered to replace it, and ended up comping it) and he said it was seasoned well.  For dessert, we split the mason jar bourbon pecan pie, and it was delicious, with a really delicious ice cream on top.\\n\\nThis location may not have quite lived up to our expectations from the original, but I'd be happy to end up here again if I'm in the area.\",\n",
       " u\"A group of eight of us came here because Burgatory couldn't seat us (big surprise there) and none of us had been at this location before so we were willing to give it a shot.  They were able to seat us, not at the same table but at two adjacent tables.  We were flexible and more than happy to take that.\\n\\nI had the Bourbonzola burger.  It wasn't the best burger I had ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.  It satisfied the craving I had and that was really all I expected.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving this place a four star is the beer.  I had the High-Level IPA and it was fantastic.  Rock Bottom is know for its beer and they did not disappoint.  Everyone in our group that had beer was impressed.\\n\\nDon't go to Rock Bottom necessarily expecting the best food you've ever had and you won't be disappointed with the experience.  What you can do though is go expecting some pretty damn good beer.  Do that and you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " u'Food was very good and reasonably priced. Had great draft choices. I would recommend going early especially on the weekends or sit in the bar area. Very crowded and noisy',\n",
       " u'I\\'ve been coming to Rock Bottom for many years and am a loyal member of their \"mug club\", which, if you come more than once, you should sign up for because membership comes with a few nice perks.\\nRock Bottom brews some of their own beers with a nice variety of ambers, reds, and IPAs.  Typically when I\\'m here I like to sit at the bar or in one of the high tops near the bar where you can seat yourself.  If weather permits they also have a nice sized patio where you can also dine.\\nUsually I\\'m here to share appetizers and my go to is the ballpark soft pretzels with the cheese dip.  They also serve some pretty good nachos. \\nWhen ordering from the menu I\\'ve found the grilled chicken BBQ sandwich to be a HUGE HIT.  This is one delicious sandwich.  \\nPrices are reasonable, service is typically good, and the beer is flowing.  Nice option when in the Waterfront area.',\n",
       " u\"If you want rock bottom food, head to Rock Bottom. Slow service, horrible, horrible food.   Was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza.   The enchiladas were supposed to be chicken and had two tiny strips of chicken and I'm talking minuscule.   Rice was still cold when it was served a second time a half hour later.   Manager apologized and waitress offered us something while we waited for our food for the second time.   I don't know whose fault it was, but there are clearly some problems in house.   I'll take the blame for ordering chicken enchiladas at a brewery but wow, they were so horrid!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm not someone that's mechanically inclined, so I can't say for sure that the deal I got was a good one. But that said Alan and the crew at Master Muffler certainly appears to have done a great job fixing my car to a degree better than I expected and at a price much lower than I was expecting. And with a great warranty on their work I feel comfortable knowing that if there is a problem I'll be covered. I would absolutely recommend them to all my friends.\",\n",
       " u\"I have a little bit of mechanical knowledge, but not enough to land me a job as a mechanic. I try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanics. \\n\\nI called a handful of shops to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolts on my 05 Grand Cherokee. Alan (owner) quoted me $250 per side (I have the 5.7 V8, so there are 2 sides) to fix it. Sure enough, it was $250 out the door. Alan is a great guy that knows his stuff. If it doesn't need to be fixed, he'll tell you it doesn't need to be fixed. BUT, if it does need to be fixed, it really does need fixing. He even checked on a couple of other things and made some recommendations for other specialty shops for projects I plan on doing on this Jeep, which he didn't have to do. \\n\\nI chose to give Master a shot after my normal go-to shop in Monroeville didn't return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold. Some of the reviews on Google for Master are unfair, with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personalities. If you want to question what the mechanic tells you needs to be done, fine. Just make sure you know what you're talking about. If you have zero mechanical knowledge, don't tell the mechanic how to do their job. Alan won't blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand. If you want your car fixed, take it to Master. \\n\\nThanks again, Alan, for giving me the opportunity to boast on the Jeep forums about only paying $250 for a repair that many have shelled out $1K+ to fix! You're my new go-to shop for our vehicles. \\n\\n(If you're curious as to their hours, I was there a little after 7AM. They are first come, first serve.) Don't be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minutes after pulling into the lot. Oh, and don't park in front of the garage doors like a tool!\",\n",
       " u'Terrible customer service, disrespectful in fact. I towed my vehicle to Master Muffler in the evening. The owner called me at 645 am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot. He told me he wouldn\\'t work on the vehicle and that I had to pick it back up by the end of the day. I said this was a secondary vehicle and I asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience, he said \"it doesn\\'t work like that\".  Never going back again  and I would advise against Master Muffler to all others.',\n",

I\\'ve never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \\n\\nThe two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don\\'t mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn\\'t good and the prices are high.

Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won\\'t seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\\n\\nThe \"box office\" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don\\'t get the whole hoopla with the window.\\n\\nAll in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good.',\n",

We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10.

She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!\\n\\nThe sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.

You may know Doug Benson from the hit documentary \"Super High Me.\"\\n\\nOk so: \\nPROS \\nWonderfully talented comedians \\nClean bathrooms \\nPretty wait staff \\nhas Coors Light on tap ( 5.75 per draft) \\nEvery seat in the house is a good seat \\n\\nCons:\\nExpensive drinks\\nExpensive food \\nFlavorless food \\nDirty silverware \\nFar from my house \\nMayo with french fries \\n\\nAny way, I have enjoyed all my visits to the Waterfront.  I can certainly see myself seeing more shows at the Improve.  The club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly. \\n\\nBring a lot of money with you, you\\'re going to need it. I don\\'t know if it\\'s true everywhere but at this Improve there is are 2 item person, minimum order requirement.  \\n\\nThey served us warm Mayo with our fries, what is this Holland!!! That sh*t was gross. It was both gross and also unusual.\\n\\nAnyhow to catch a comedy show at the Improve is a pleasure.',\n",
       " u\"The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food, however.  Blah.\\n\\nFirst off, If you go to a show, please note there is a two item per person minimum.  This means that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drinks, you are REQUIRED to choose two items each.    \\n\\nSecond, the sodas are NOT FREE REFILLS!  I learned that one the hard way.  Get water. \\n\\nThird, before tipping your server, please make sure she hasn't already taken her cut out.  Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \\n\\nOverall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again.\",\n",
       " u'The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\\n\\nThe setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you\\'d think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it\\'s an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\\n\\nIt\\'s too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\\n\\nBut the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They\\'re very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I\\'d consider reasonable given the quality, and I\\'d begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You\\'re forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn\\'t want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I\\'d rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\\n\\nStill, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\\n\\nA few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\\n1 - A lot of the drinks didn\\'t have prices on them.  I know this isn\\'t uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it\\'s an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It\\'s not that hard.\\n2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I\\'m calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\\n3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you\\'re trying to trick me.  It\\'s kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one\\'s customers.\\n4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don\\'t come with free refills, the servers shouldn\\'t ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don\\'t offer refills, but I\\'d be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there\\'s a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn\\'t mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don\\'t even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings.',\n",
       " u\"I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\\n\\nThings you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\\n\\nThe wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\\n\\np.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble\",\n",
       " u'My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon.',\n",
       " u\"Who doesn't love to laugh? The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year. The venue is clean. The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four. In addition, since they started offering a large Groupon discount, the Improv has been packed. Be aware that if you only have two people in your party, they may seat strangers at your table who are 6 feet tall and block your view.\",\n",
       " u'We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife\\'s work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn\\'t any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down pur\\xe9ed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn\\'t taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn\\'t make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn\\'t edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren\\'t coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn\\'t even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \\n\\nThe comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I\\'d rather be there...how I\\'d rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I\\'d rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I\\'d rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\\n\\nMy car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\\n\\nThe Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that\\'s the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I\\'d steer clear of those. Unless there is a can\\'t miss type of comedian here, I can\\'t ever picture going back to the Improv. I\\'d give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.',\n",
       " u'Spent New Years Eve at the Comedy Club to bring the new year.\\n\\n\\nI am new but it was a good time.   We had unlimited champagne, fruit and cheese.   The comedy was good.\\n\\nThe service was great.\\n\\nThe atmposhere was okay but it was a comedy clud :-).   \\n\\nYou should check it out - Comedy clubs bring a little spice to the city :-)\\n\\nEnjoy!',\n",
       " u\"This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. \\n\\nThe servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. \\n\\nThe only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late.\",\n",
       " u\"I have been here twice in the last month. It's a pretty great time. My first visit, the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table. We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I'll be going back soon!\",\n",
       " u\"Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\\n\\nThe comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back!\",\n",
       " u\"I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.\",\n",
       " u\"I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\\n\\nSo I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\\n\\nSo the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \\n\\nThe one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \\n\\nI would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience!\",\n",
       " u'It isn\\'t often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn\\'t offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she\\'ll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \"What about our food?\", we asked. \"Oh\", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That\\'s all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \"do you want me to take your food back?\". Really?!?! \"Do you want me to take your food back?\" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don\\'t want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn\\'t want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn\\'t get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don\\'t know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you\\'re interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine\\'s Day.',\n",
       " u\"My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I am very particular about where I sit, and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose, especially if it's on a Thursday or Sunday night, since those aren't particularly busy nights.\\n\\nI did have one bad experience, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 (it only takes one poor experience, people!). My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.\\n\\nAt any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. \\n\\nOverall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. \\n\\nAfterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.\\n\\nThat being said, I will most likely return to the Improv....but not for the service. Because it's a great place to see comedy shows and isn't that expensive. Customer service is terrible.\",\n",
       " u\"I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime!\",\n",
       " u'Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back.',\n",
       " u\"If The Improv chain didn't bring in such amazing comedians, this place would be totally screwed. \\n\\nI always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.\\n\\nFirst you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. \\n\\nThe improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front! \\n\\nThe point is, a night at the Improv will be fun, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair.\",\n",
       " u\"Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend.\",\n",
       " u\"Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter!\",\n",
       " u\"So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\\nMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\\xe9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better.\",\n",
       " u\"It's sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy acts (other than the big 'uns in the Cultural District). I hate this place's M.O. The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better. I've been to other comedy places in other cities and they often have minimums but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality.  The Improv's saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap tickets.\",\n",
       " u'The food is why I give them three stars.  Burger was processed and 1/2 raw, loaded fries where some random cheese.  Comedy depends on who you see.',\n",
       " u\"Went to see Bret Ernst (one of my fave Comedians).  Tickets say seating begins at 9pm for the 9:30pm show.  Well, a line had formed outside because they hadn't opened the doors.  That is all well and good if it is summertime but it was 4 degrees.  People stood out there upwards of 20 minutes, freezing.  They didn't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready.  Seating is first come, first served.  Whoever designed this place should be shot.  There is no lobby to hold people before a show.  The Improv in Cleveland is superb.  That location has a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have ushers seat you.  The Pittsburgh Improv is a disaster layout-wise.  Beverage service was fine.  It got really, really warm in the room and even the comedian was sweating like a freak show.  Of course Bret and Bill Crawford were as hilarious as ever but man, this Improv, as a comedy venue, sucks.\",\n",
       " u\"We've been to the improv comedy club twice now and both shows were amazing; even the opening acts! \\n\\nThe only downfall is the two drink minimum, which I understand, but their prices make it ridiculous. We stuck to beer because we knew it wouldn't be watered down. Our waitress was horrible. We did not have an opportunity to order our second drinks until the other waitresses were bringing out checks. If our waitress was more attentive, the club could have made more money off of us. Oh well. \\n\\nI would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced. \\n\\nThe only other thing I'm not a fan of is the seating. We were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth. The last few people who arrived got the turned around seats in front of us. I feel that the club should invest in long, thin tables like bars have so everyone has a surface to put their food or drinks. \\n\\nOverall, we love the comedians so we'll definitely be back.\",\n",
       " u\"Nice little venue for quality fun.  I saw Greg Warren here last night and had a really good time.  \\n\\nCheck out yippit.com or sign up for Goldstar.com before buying tickets at full price. You can usually find substantial discounts for shows on one of those two sites. Sure there's a two drink minimum but I'm thinking that it helps pay for the comics and helps keep the price of admission down.  When you think about it, it's really a win-win.\",\n",
       " u'Roxy was very funny. Would definitely come back to see her!',\n",
       " u'Positives: They regularly bring in national acts.  I have seen many of my favorite comics here.  Also, you get an opportunity to briefly meet the entertainers on your way out.\\n\\nNegatives: Drink prices are high, and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional.  Entertainer-wise, there is a local comic who opens up for many of the main attractions.  I have seen him open up no less than four times over a span of 3 years, and his act is exactly the same every time.  I have it almost memorized.\\n\\nContinue doing the things you do well, and try to improve the things that almost everyone on Yelp complains about, and you\\'ll be looking at 5 stars from most.  No one wants to come to the Improv to get \"Straint Up\" (see what I did there, Improv?)',\n",
       " u'I love a good night of comedy. But recently i have gone to a couple and they were not all that funny one was a special event too. I would recommend eating at another restaurant prices seem to be a little over priced.',\n",
       " u\"I went to The Improv tonight with my husband and some friends and saw Theo Von. So funny. We had a great time.  Waitress was friendly and very helpful without being intrusive during the show at all. Pretty few options for food, and when you're with 2 people who don't drink and there's a 2-drink minimum, or 2-item minimum, the minimal food options are kind of a bummer. But it was still a great time.\",\n",
       " u\"Quality of the show and comedians = 5 stars. I saw Ian Bagg and he tore down the house. Just the opening 3 minutes of his act had me dying. I was involved in bringing all the big name comedy acts to Ohio State as a student and I have to say I was really surprised at how good Ian's improv was. So there's no complaint here. \\n\\nQuality of Groupon's value = 1 star. So I still had to pay for tickets. Yep at $20 for 2 people. Not bad but the 2 item minimum is zero bang for your buck. The menu online is incorrect and the actual prices are EVEN higher than a $8 slice of frozen cake and $11 for a plate of 8 chicken nuggets. Holy moly, it's like cheap pub food at high end bistro price. Then you have to tip on top of that $50 bill (PLUS the $20 for tickets!) for two people and a crappy meal? Wow. I get that the place is trying to gouge money out of you for a good show. Well...try this--charge $25 per person for the tickets and have the menu be optional. This way, you can guarantee high ticket sales but also get the people who will drink and eat there regardless. \\n\\nPortions are reasonable, I suppose. I got the BLT meal and chocolate chip cheesecake. Left me very full but you best believe the only reason I ate there was because I needed to hit that 2-item min. Seating was pretty cramped because you'll have to sit with strangers. \\n\\nI went to the 7pm show which was great because you can be seated early and just eat while you wait for the show to start. I saw this longass line when I left that I assumed to be the 9:30pm show with everyone waiting outside in the cold. Seems like a crappy setup for the later show! Service was haphazard. Some of the waitresses seemed pretty attentive and quick but mine was particularly slow. He wasn't rude but twice I had to ask the other waitress for sauce and a water refill. We got up to get napkins ourselves. I would wave to catch his attention and he would hurry off the opposite direction. Ugh. \\n\\nPlease, Groupon, there needs to be reform on this pricing structure. Come out with a new deal of paying full price for the tickets and then waiving the 2-item minimum!\",\n",
       " u\"Went there for a comedy open mic competition.  A friend of mine was performing--he was excellent and won his competition.  \\n\\nThe club itself is pretty nice--great layout and the staff were all nice.  I didn't drink so can't comment on the quality of food or drinks, but everything looked good and the wait staff seemed attentive enough.  \\n\\nLocated in Homestead in Waterfront area.  Not as cool as if it were in the city, but still pretty good.\",\n",
       " u'Came here for a show last week with my family and had a good time.  Our opening acts were not the best, but the headliner brought some good laughs from the crowd.  When we arrived the man taking tickets was very friendly and okay with the fact that 2 members of our party were not with us. We just told him what they looked like and he let us go through anyway.  \\nWhat happened inside next was what I thought would lead to bad review.  We were a party of 5 and they have mostly 4 person tables and then long booth benches with cocktail tables in front of them.  Our host tried to seat us at a 4 person table with a 5th chair on he end only to have a very rude waitress come up and say we couldn\\'t do this. Our host then said \"she\\'s your waitress and you\\nDon\\'t want to make her mad already\". They then tried to seat us in between parties on the booth bench against the back wall which with large men in our party that was not okay.  We decided to move to an end table and try again with a 5th chair and the waitress in this area was fine with it and extremely friendly. She saved the review! The drinks were fine, the wine list in not great but for comedy club drinks it was expected.  Kudos to our waitress for being accommodating and pleasant, just wish they were all.',\n",
       " u\"Went for the first time last night and despite some of the iffy reviews, we had a great time. All of the staff was friendly, from the host at the front to the other staff and the wait staff was attentive (but we didn't get food, so I can't speak for how quickly ordering and getting food would be). Prices for drinks are a bit much, for 4 small drafts our check came out to about $50, but I did snag tickets on Goldstar for $10 a piece so I feel like it probably balanced out and the 3 comedians were great so I won't complain. I will say the food didn't really look all that great in comparison to the prices, but I can't speak for how it tastes. Overall, it's a fun place, no issues, I'd go again.\",\n",
       " u\"The Waterfront at Homestead is insane, and saves me the trip of driving all the way to Ross Park Mall. Anyway, the Giant Eagle here is enormous, as you'd imagine. It's still a standard Giant Eagle, aka the best grocery store ever.\",\n",
       " u\"This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:\\n\\n1. They sell beer!\\n2. Huuuuuge produce selection\\n3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\\n4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\\n5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\\n\\nThe store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \\n\\nIt seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes.\",\n",
       " u'Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection.',\n",
       " u'Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery.',\n",
       " u'Wahhhhh!!!! They\\'re remodeling this one and it\\'s frustrating! I swear I don\\'t mind change. I really don\\'t~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That\\'s A-ok with me, I didn\\'t use the pharmacy anyway. \\n\\nBut THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and \"ethnic food\" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I\\'m getting?? \\n\\nDid I mention I don\\'t mind change? But here\\'s the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It\\'s kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I\\'m not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don\\'t....wahhh! \\n\\nOk, I\\'ll stop crying. I know I\\'ll eventually be back. I\\'m sure (??) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they\\'re done. But I can\\'t take it for right now. I\\'ll be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former #1 store is all shiny and new again.',\n",
       " u\"I like this Giant Eagle.\\nThey have the organic section and they're currently(Feb 2011) in the process of remodeling too, which is both annoying (now) and exciting (for the future).\\n\\nPROS:\\nAlways seems to be decent parking available;\\nThey have those cute little double-tier carts;\\nOrganics section;\\nWine Vending Machine (that's freaking awesome--Yay, Pennsylvania!);\\nLots of Self-Check-Out lanes;\\n\\nCONS:\\nSometimes the staff is a bit cranky (but that can occur anywhere, i guess);\",\n",
       " u\"As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district.\",\n",
       " u\"Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose.\",\n",
       " u\"You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \\n\\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \\n\\nI  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it!\",\n",
       " u\"This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot.\",\n",
       " u\"This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  \\n\\nThey did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.\",\n",
       " u\"oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like.\",\n",
       " u'This is a absolutely beautiful Giant Eagle.  I only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared foods section, but I was rather impressed by how clean it was.  It was 9 oclock at night, and they still had a huge section of prepared foods available.  The Starbucks inside was closed, probably due to the fact it was a Sunday night, but that is another plus!',\n",
       " u\"In the market for unsalted cashews? How about oyster sauce? Ahhh, here's an easy one: bean sprouts?\\n\\nWell if you are, keep a crystal ball and rabbit's foot handy if you're planning on shopping at this Giant Eagle because you'll need both a soothsaying ability as well as a fair share of luck on your quest at this dive. \\n\\nFor a store of this size, they are frequently out of stock on items as common as jalape\\xf1o peppers to specialty foods items like flat rice noodles. Maybe I'm the only person in Homestead buying these items...wait that doesn't make sense, they'd be in stock if I were!\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and either go to the Greenfield, Regent Square or Kennywood Giant Eagles. All three stores are much smaller but seem to stock rare items like unsalted (or as of late sea salted) Xochitl tortilla chips and Honey Nut Cheerios.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm with Rachel C. on this one. You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you, Waterfront Giant Eagle, are not bad and pretty close to where I live.\",\n",
       " u\"I drive near this Giant Eagle on my daily commute, so I shop at this location approximately once/week. The location is pretty, and the beer selection is descent. They carry my favorite lambic, so I really can't complain! They also have a very nice health and beauty section. Overall, they usually have the products that I need.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be wait time to check out. They never have enough cashiers at peak hours. The store has like 20 checkout lanes, but generally only 5-8 open at a time. I always dread checking out, and whenever I see that checkout lines look relatively clear, I hurry around the store and quickly gather the products that I plan to buy.\",\n",
       " u'I found everything I needed and I liked the expansion, the antipasta bar is on point and they sale Vanilla Coke which made my hubby very happy. \\n\\nGreat store.',\n",
       " u\"Let me preface this by saying, I generally compare all grocery stores to Publix, maybe even Kroger. That being said, the one thing Giant Eagle (GE) has going for it is the quality and selection of items. There is no question that it has everything you could want. That's where the praise ends. Let's just do this numerically...\\n\\n1. Prices are outrageous. If you walk 100 yards over to the Target next to it, you'll find some of the same items for 30-40% cheaper. A bag of Gevalia coffee is $7.99 at GE, the same coffee at Target is $4.99. And it's not just coffee, and not just Target. Giant Eagle has little other grocer competition in Pittsburgh. This being the case, if you're not near an Aldi's, Target or Walmart, you have to go to GE for stuff. They're banking on this lack of competition. \\n\\n2. Parking lots are thrashed every day, all the time. Now, maybe you don't care. But when I go in the morning, they've been open maybe 30 minutes and there are shopping carts littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building. They clearly don't bring them in at the end of the night. They also rarely have any small baskets near the door, you'll need to hunt for one. It's just laziness and a lack of care, on both accounts. They don't care about the appearance of the outside, nor the convenience for the customers. \\n\\n3. I don't normally mind the self-checkout, but only if I have a limited number of items. If I need a full grocery order, I'm going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashiers working the registers, on a Saturday. The lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, but I also have to ring up and bag my cart full of groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make you do that!\\n\\nSo that's about it. If you don't mind paying much higher than average grocery prices, ringing and bagging your cart full of groceries and generally being an afterthought as a customer, than Giant Eagle in Waterfront is awesome!\",\n",
       " u\"This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.  Just don't take your dry cleaning here.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve stopped by here a few times (most recently tonight) to pick up random groceries.  This store is located next to one of the bike trails that I frequent, hence its convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.\\n\\nOn the positive side, I appreciate the size of this store and the selection of products.  In terms of size, it\\'s larger than the Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence my standard of comparison), and I\\'d say the product selection is very similar.  Unlike the MD, when I\\'ve visited, the aisles have seemed fairly empty of customers, which may be due to the times of my visits (usually between 7-8pm), as well as the size of the store.  Because it\\'s not a Market District, the prices are a bit less expensive, which is nice.\\n\\nOn the negative side, the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customers and/or employees, despite that I\\'ve only purchased a couple of items at a time.  The \"express\" lanes move at the speed of molasses, and the self-checkouts are even worse.  Speaking of which, this store has *way* too many self-checkout lanes (about a third of the lanes), and the non-express ones with the belts are unintuitive.\\n\\nPrior to tonight, I would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5.  However, checkout tonight was even more of a PITA than it usually is.  None of the normal express checkout lanes were staffed with cashiers, despite that I saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another.  So, I was forced to use one of the many self-checkout lanes.  Normally, I don\\'t mind this, esp. when I\\'m only purchasing a couple of items, but the empty self-checkout lane that I spotted was one with a conveyor belt, and I couldn\\'t figure out how to use it (not that it mattered, since I had only one item, but the self-checkout lanes must be operated using a very specific procedure--see below).  So, I moved over to one of the express self checkout lanes (similar to those in the Shadyside MD), which I knew how to operate.  However, I still managed to bungle the process since I forgot to scan my one item *before* I put it on the scale that doubles as a bagging station, so I had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employees to come over and key in an authorization code so I could pay.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if the self-checkout stands that GE uses are standard in the industry, since I\\'ve never used them anywhere else, but I *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process.  In order to use the self-checkout stations, each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale, and if the weight isn\\'t correct for any reason (including using your own bag), an employee is summoned to check it.  I assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting, but (1) it\\'s a major PITA for both customers and employees; (2) most of the employees (including the one I dealt with tonight) don\\'t care, and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned; and (3) I doubt most shoplifters pay for any of the items they\\'re pilfering--they most likely just stuff them into their purse, clothes, etc. and walk out!  /rant\\n\\n3.5 stars.',\n",
       " u\"Just about every you need.\\n\\nWith great hours, a solid hot bar, sushi (if you're into that),  a dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons of produce, bakery and butchers counter you can't go wrong. Two things that drive me crazy always needing to use my perks card for self check out and the lack of hand carts in the front. I always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back, super annoying. \\n\\nThat said its a small, and easily repairable (hint) issue that shouldn't keep you from visiting.\",\n",
       " u\"I don't know why, but I just can't like this location very much.  I lived in the area for a little over three years and would always go to another GE before this one.  Maybe it's the way it's set up or maybe it's the way that the lighting seems so very dim.\\n\\nThe selection is typical for any GE, broad and expansive.  Some prices are a bit steep.  \\n\\nThis location, like many others, has expanded their pharmacy/health care area.  Which is nice, it saves an extra trip to a drug store.\",\n",
       " u\"One of the best grocery stores in the area. Good produce, wide variety of cheeses, good cuts of meat and there's even a six pack shop on the premise.\",\n",
       " u'Years ago I would have given the Big Bird 2 stars. What changed my mind? Competitive pricing. \\nThanks, GE for making it worthwhile to shop your sales. While your no Aldi, you definitely are winning on this front. \\n\\nThis is my goto GE. Always clean, organized and great selection. Added beer a couple years ago and the deli, prepared foods are up to par as well. \\nAlways busy and parking never an issue.',\n",
       " u'This is a review of the Pharmacy. After having them screw up a third time I felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid. The first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of Synthroid, about 1/10th of what I needed. I ended up so sick after 2 weeks of taking too little that I was half dead before the problem was caught. Their response when I told them was to say \"oops\" and \"it won\\'t happen again\". Not even a sorry, and it never did happen again b/c I went to Costco after that. This latest time was classic. I came with a simple scrip. Costco was closed so I went to Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes the finally inform me that they can\\'t fill it b/c the scrip isn\\'t specific enough (it was for a common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn\\'t bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner, just made me wait and wait and wait until I pitched a fit to tell me that they couldn\\'t fill it. It was late and I went to Rite Aid in Sq. Hill with the same exact scrip and they had ZERO issues filling it quickly. WTF? How can it be easy peasy at Rite Aid but Giant Eagle can\\'t even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out? I wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all. It seems like they aren\\'t even staffing the pharmacy with trained techs, just random people off of the street. \\n\\nDon\\'t waste your time, or risk your health. Go to any other pharmacy in town, avoid Giant Eagle.',\n",
       " u'I luv store, plenty of cashiers. My father eats there couple times a week. He is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran. Last week he was told they no longer doing that program. Today he went to the Edgewood Giant Eagle and they gave him free coffee.',\n",
       " u'This giant eagle is one of the only things I miss about  old house. The produce section and deli were great. Also had an overall nice selection of everything.',\n",
       " u'This is a great supermarket!  All of the staples.  Great deli, market square and bakery.  Fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetables and fruits cut and packaged.  Love the fact that I can shop, drop dry cleaning, and pick up pharmacy items in one stop.  Close to other shopping and wonderful restaurants.',\n",
       " u'I personally like this giant eagle. I dont think i\\'ve given any GE 4 stars, so thats saying something. \\n\\nI should start by saying that i live in southside, so most GE\\'s are equal or worse than that location.  The waterworks location is decent in my book. They sell beer, they have a cute little cafe sitting area, they sell \"meals for 2\" in their prepared foods section, produce always seems great, cashiers are friendly ect. The location seems pretty large. I also like how there are 2 entrances (one at pharmacy.) The parking lot is pretty large so it helps having another entrance for cold or rainy days. I am at this location alot more than the southside GE since my gym is in the waterfront. It makes it easier to get everything done in one plaza.\\n\\nI can\\'t hate on this GE. It seems similar to a market district but i dont believe that it is...... yet.',\n",
       " u'One comfy seat in the entire place, but they have a cafe, they have good books to look at, and they are open until 11pm.  What more could you want?  Why an APPLE PURSE of course!  And a nice Earl Gray tea thrown in for good measure.  Wow...I love this place.  I am such a nerd...only a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading as much as I do.  The extra amenities just make it that much more enjoyable.',\n",
       " u\"Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while.\",\n",
       " u'I still cannot believe that Pittsburgh has no independent bookstores!  As a result of this I have ended up spending a fair bit of time at this Barnes and Noble location.  As with all Barnes and Noble stores it has a cafe and a decent selection of popular titles.  I am a bit surprised at how smallish it is compared to other stores in this chain.  \\n\\nThe bargain section seems to be perpetually picked through.  The selection is ok in that it is well stocked but sometimes a bit disorganized from other customers pawing through the books, less popular titles are a bit hard to find.  The customer service here is pretty good.\\n\\nThey could use more chairs.',\n",
       " u\"Great Barnes and Noble location, and they have plenty of books that'll help you pass the time.\",\n",
       " u\"Barnes & Noble, it's like the Wal-Mart of bookstores.  Beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitors and mom and pop type stores alike.  \\n\\nI'm not quite sure whether I'm in a cafe, at a newspaper stand, a book store, a CD shop, a movie house or a flea market sometimes.  With all the tables and shelves that  you have to dodge it's a bit hard to figure it out.  Feels like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.\\n\\nI don't know about y'all, but I'd rather buy my books from a place that has more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this.\",\n",
       " u'Such nice staff.  \\n\\nI really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  \\n\\nThe store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  \\n\\nI really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.',\n",
       " u\"I find this location, clean and well organized, but that's not the reason it's getting 5 stars! \\n\\nI called today to look into whether or not their May issues of magazines were out (I need them for my job) and Erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine I asked about! \\n\\nNow that is customer service! \\n\\nWell done, well done!\",\n",
       " u\"I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.\\n\\nSo amidst all the books, newspapers and magazines they have an audio and video section. The prices aren't anything to rave about. I can buy the same movies online for a lot cheaper there's just the waiting period. I do shop here sometimes for there discount books. I found a lot of great recipe and mystery books for really cheap, like under $5. That's a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who has a great selection of books for literally half the price of retailers, how can you beat those prices. \\n\\nB&N is more of a hangout spot with books in case you want to buy one right there and then. But everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is. I'd rather shop online for anything i really want. It's just not worth it to buy it wholesale.\",\n",
       " u\"This bookstore is absolutely packed full of stuff! They have lots of books, a display of Nooks, DVDs and CDs, miscellaneous items like notebooks and calendars, and a cafe. Though a large assortment is nice, I feel like the space is very cramped. I have purchased a couple books from here - which were pretty easy to find - and have purchased food items from the cafe. \\n\\nThe cafe is not very impressive. I've been pretty underwhelmed by all the food items that I've purchased here. I got a slice of quiche here last night when I only had 10 minutes before a hair appointment at Ulta across the street. Not only did they take 5 minutes to microwave it, but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot. \\n\\nA little band was singing and playing a variety of instruments while I was here. I wasn't very impressed until I realized that they were high school kids. I thought it as really nice that Barnes & Noble would let them perform in the store... and a great way for B&N to get a lot of their family members in the store, too.\",\n",
       " u\"Are B&N not allowed to have lounge areas anymore? I used to love studying and doing work in their comfy chairs and sit there allllll day... but I feel like within the last 4 years or so, I haven't been in a single B&N that had such areas anymore. I love books and have always felt that B&N can give you a good deal. But I'm not a fan of this particular location because it's not that big. Although, it is pretty clean!\\n\\nThe Starbucks area they have is okay. The starbucks employees in these types of locations are always not the best..but I don't go there for the coffee obviously. I do find it annoying that they don't take Starbucks giftcards though - I believe they take B&N giftcards and you can also apply your B&N membership discount.\\n\\nAlso, their bathrooms are pretty atrocious. If you can hold it, I would advise you to hold it.\\n\\nParking: the location is within a shopping area..so I wouldn't say it has it's own private lot per se, but it's an open lot and not actual 'street parking.'\",\n",
       " u\"I love books. I love to look at them, hold them, read the cover, thumb through the pages, and then finally I love to dig into a juicy story. When I'm in the area I love coming in here for a latte and book browsing/reading. Most of the time I cave and buy a book.\\n\\nThis store is clean and their employees are helpful and kind. They have two entrances/exits available, a fairly large section for movies & music, study guides, and other organized sections like self-help and history. I personally love the variety of cook books there. One of the attractive points of this store is a cafe. I can come in, sit down, read a magazine or book and just chill. The downside is the chairs aren't super comfortable (to me) and the cafe is usually packed with people. I wish they had more seating options around the store.\\n\\nIt's a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned. There's a lot to find in there so come back and browse!\",\n",
       " u'There is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store. \\n\\nThis Barnes and Noble carries on a long history of excellence. They always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking.',\n",
       " u\"It seems every time we go to Waterfront we end up coming here every time. I like the store but it seems rather daunting in that it's so huge.  Pretty much every time we come here if we haven't already hit up the Starbucks in the middle of the walkable part of the Waterfront where many of the retail stores are we'll go to this one which isn't that far away.\\n\\nThere's much more seating at this Starbucks than the one in the middle as well as it just feels less cramped.  The store hasn't changed much, most of the special and clearance stuff is at the front while the alternative entrance at the back is where all the music and movies are.  The store is pretty organized though by type whether it's children's, fiction, magazines, games and toys etc there's pretty much something for everybody.  \\n\\nThe Nook section is pretty much right when you walk in through the main entrance.  I do like this store however I wonder how long it will exist with everything like Amazon and e-Readers changing how people get their material these days.\",\n",
       " u'Went to Barnes and Noble Waterfront with 3 books on my list.       First one there were several books by the same name so they wanted the name of the author.  Went to look it up on my phone.....Barnes and Noble wifi had blocked me.  Wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my information....NOT.  Long story short they only had one of the 3 books I was looking for and it was $4 less on Amazon....Lost this customer.',\n",
       " u\"Their food is amazing. They have a deal that you can get a soup and salad for 6.95! Also they have drinks from Starbucks and deserts from the cheesecake factory. What I'm eating right now is the tomato caprese which is delicious and their soup which is homemade chicken noodle soup which is awesome and the tiramisu cup which I never had before. You should try it if you're in the waterfront in homestead.\",\n",
       " u'I stopped in here yesterday looking for something specific...I wanted to find a book with lateral thinking puzzles or some type of mini mysteries. You know, the kind where there is a short story (2 or 3 pages) with some type of problem or \\'who-done-it\\' to solve at the end. My bestie and I go to the pool a lot in the summer and I thought it would be something fun to sit and read while we were lounging out. I used to read them all of the time when I was younger and thought it would be something different. And yes, I know I could check online but, hey, I was already here.\\n\\nAny-who....I go in and easily find the \"customer service\" area, which is located in the middle of the store. It is a round kiosk. One woman is being waited on by an employee. There are 5 other employees standing behind the kiosk, talking among themselves. One of the workers notices me and comes over to help. I tell him what I\\'m searching for and he quickly looks it up on the computer. He takes me to an area of puzzles, but they are crosswords, sudokus, coloring books, etc. I tell him these aren\\'t what I\\'m looking for. He said he might have something where the magazines are. He goes off to check while I look around. He comes back with some magazines, but it still isn\\'t what I\\'m interested in. (sorry c dub). I thank him and continue to browse on my own. \\n\\nPros: the place is clean and well organized. Areas are pretty well marked by genre, discount books, cards, etc. The guy who assisted me was friendly and tried to be as helpful as possible. \\n\\nCons: They didn\\'t have what I was looking for. Also, it was not very appropriate to see a bunch of staff standing around the middle of the store while there are a lot of customers around.',\n",
       " u'one of my favorite places to go in pittsburgh with friends. good place to chill, eat, drink and watch the game, and maybe some pool afterwards. the food is not bad, they have pretty good deals for those who are on a budget. \"dollar burger night\" where you build your own burger is fun, but the patties can be dry sometimes, so remember to get them sauced. iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have, the wings arent as good as you would like, i had tried the spicy killer ones and didnt even have to drink water. but overall its a nice place to go because it\\'s cleaner than most bars you will go and it serves better food than other places as well.',\n",
       " u\"Nice venue,  good food, great beer, awful service.  Staying at the Sheraton here I've patronized Bar Louie a dozen times recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time, without exception.\",\n",
       " u'I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I\\'ve seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It\\'s spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you\\'ll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob\\'s long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don\\'t remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie\\'s I\\'ve been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I\\'m being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It\\'s probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn\\'t that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you\\'re more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.',\n",
       " u'Fantastic food.\\n This place is mainly a \"bar\" and does get crowded but I really like the pizza here.  In fact I\\'ve never had a bad meal.  The staff are ussually very helpful but it does get a bit loud inside when crowded.',\n",
       " u\"Don't even think about not getting the pretzel dippers its pretzel sticks with honey mustard, cinnamon butter, and a spicy queso dip. The queso is my favorite but they were all delish. I also got the bruschetta which was very garlicky but delicious. 5-7 M-F is 1/2 off appetizers so I was able to get both the pretzel sticks and bruschetta for 7 bucks as a meal. The menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad. We didn't get drinks but some looked good...\",\n",
       " u'An absolute must if you\\'re going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it\\'s mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.\\n\\nAnyway, the small plates made for good \"upscale\" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn\\'t match up exactly.\\n\\nBe warned that the seats make you feel like you\\'re going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.',\n",
       " u'The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  \\nLovely for loud large groups\\nVaried menu with some original items\\nGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge bar\\nFun location\\nGood place to take out of towners.\\n\\nThe Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich, our order wasn\\'t as described because the kitchen was out of \"lots of things\"  (Tell us when we order, not when you deliver the meal without elements on the plate.)  \\nCan be loud--not a place for a romantic date...\\nThe bathroom condition was really bad.\\n\\nThe server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow. \\n\\nThe view was great, and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to \"Pour some sugar on me\"  seriously?!?!?  Yes!   Classy eh?',\n",
       " u'Went there on Saturday night following a movie at loews.  We sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their  multiple large flatscreen tvs.   Ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadillas.   The calamari was crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark.   It wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey.   The menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan Ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.   Miller Lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites.  \\n\\nGreat atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game.\\nFood looks like its hit or miss\\n\\nAll in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie.',\n",
       " u'The words \"epic fail\" get thrown around a lot these days....but I really feel like they apply in this situation.\\n\\nWe went on Friday, April 2 and arrived at 5:10pm.  It was busy, but not crowded....no waiting for a table.  Half price apps and drinks -- we ordered at 5:20.\\n\\nThe food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn\\'t arrive till almost 6pm.

We placed one order for 6 draft beers at 6:15...they arrived at 6:52.  *37 minutes for beer.*\\n\\nBy 7:00, we were canceling food orders which we\\'d given up on after waiting almost an hour.

We finally were able to leave around 7:30.\\n\\nBar Louie:  You are dead to me.',\n",
       " u'I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.\\n\\n20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn\\'t even realize our food hadn\\'t arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn\\'t). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn\\'t have noticed that that WASN\\'T what they ordered? Seriously?\\n\\nThe waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn\\'t have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.\\n\\nHowever, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That\\'s because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.',\n",
       " u\"Service has always been good and the food consistent, we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there's some great deals on drinks as well.\\n\\nThings that stand out to me: veggie wrap, fried zucchini, hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter, and house salad with ranch (their ranch is so good I could eat it with a spoon)\",\n",
       " u\"Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.\\n\\nRemember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie\\n\\nI can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.\\n\\nNow here comes the bad:\\n\\n1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.\\n\\n2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.\\n\\n3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.\\n\\nIt's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.\",\n",
       " u\"We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside, and it was nearly 30 minutes before the waiter even stopped to get our order.  I tried stopping a waitress but was told 'this isn't my table'.  Finally the waiter took our order.  1 Sam Adams light bottle, and one Pineapple Juice+Vodka.  After about 15minutes another waiter (maybe the manager I don't know) asked if we had been waited on. We said yes, and told him we had been waiting.  He left, and another (different) waitress came to bring us our drinks.. they were wrong.. My date was given vodka on the rocks. and I was given a Sam Adams.. \\nThey took these back, and another 10 minutes before the correct order was served.. We told them to bring another round and the check.  It was 20 minutes before they returned.. and they forgot the check.\\n\\nBy this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and I gave him my card, when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.\\n\\nfor 2 bottle beers, and 2 pineapple juice + vodka I was charged $31.03. I didn't have time to complain or ask. I won't be going back.\",\n",
       " u'Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity.',\n",
       " u\"Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here, this is a resturant that I enjoy having a meal at, when I am in the Homestead water front. On all of my visits here I have enjoyed the tempura shrimp. The dipping sauce are to die for.  I've found myself craveing the tempura shrimp, and the accompanying sauces. \\n\\nThe first time I ever had dinner here was as a birthday dinner with me and my big sister. So this resturant has sentimental value to me. I attach eating here to having a special night out in the Waterfront. \\n\\nBar Louie has some very flavorful and fun dishes for bar food, that is.\",\n",
       " u\"When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!\\n\\nNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.\",\n",
       " u\"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.\\n\\nI am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\nThis is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. \\n\\nAs I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.\",\n",
       " u\"I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie, and was hoping to be able to write a review on the food. Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact. I hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out.\",\n",

       " u\"It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition, their drinks are expensive!  Just one cocktail could run between $10-$12 and they aren't very large.  Our waitress spent more time talking to her friends at the next table than actually tending to our needs.  There are enough restaurants at the Waterfront that I don't know that I will come back here.\",\n",
       " u\"I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.\\n\\nSo why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!\\n\\nHappy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!\\n\\nI ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.\\n\\nMy recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!\",\n",
       " u\"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \\n\\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\\xe9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \\n\\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'m surprised by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot, fresh pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge. \\n\\nThey\\'ve got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.\\n\\nIn the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to \"Do the wave\\' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. I\\'ve found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. Maybe these are old reviews?',\n",
       " u\"This place was pretty good food, but the service however was just horrible. As a friend said they hire for looks, not work ethic. Plus the fact that it took forty minutes just to get a couple appetizers was ridiculous. Our server seemed more interested in the table full of girls than actually waiting on us. The couple behind us came in the same time and wasn't even attended too until after OUR appetizers were being cleared off. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good, but because of the service I won't be returning.\",\n",
       " u\"As far as chain restaurants go, Bar Louie is ok. I really like their appetizers and their salads, but I don't care for their burgers or pastas. Their drinks are ok. They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., Applebees.\\n\\nService is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying). \\n\\nThings I like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.\\n\\nGreat to stop in right before a movie at Loews, though! :-)\",\n",

       " u\"I must say, my experience last night at Bar Louie was wonderful. I was hesitant to go because of the other reviews here, but my husband convinced me to give it a try. \\nThe place is seat yourself and it's LOUD in there. I was a little underwhelmed by that at first but I got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.\\nOur service was fantastic. Courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... And the place was packed.\\nThe drinks were perfect, just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice. There were real berries mixed into that one. Yum.\\nOn to the food... My turkey/ham/Brie sandwich was delicious and my husband loved his burger. The highlight of the meal though was the Whiskey cake. Sonnet-worthy.\\nWe'll definitely go back again.\",\n",

       " u\"Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies. \\n\\nIt's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce. \\n\\nTuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.\\n\\nI'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.\",\n",
       " u'I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.

We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.',\n",
       " u\"We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server, was friendly. My husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.\\nBoth drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol.  After I finished my drink, I used my fork to dig for the blackberries at the bottom only to find (to my disgust), a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap! Ugg! Did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap?!!! She comped the drink but we won't be back.\\nCan't speak about the food since we didn't have any but atmosphere was loud and it was difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself.\",\n",
       " u\"I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order, and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left. And I have to be clear it was a Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables with people at them and I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant, especially since burgatory just opened across the street.\",\n",
       " u\"Man, haters gonna hate.  Listen, y'all, Bar Louie isn't fancy.  It's just not and their extensive martini list won't fool me.  However, the food is good ole American bar grub and their beer selection is decent.  The staff has been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friends spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hours drinking dollar beers.  As long as Bar Louie still keeps having $1 Burger Days (Tuesdays) and $1 Beer Days (Wednesdays), I will continue to be a fan.  FYI, It's a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot.\",\n",
       " u'The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!',\n",
       " u'Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well',\n",
       " u\"Eh, this place was okay but it was sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a Saturday night.\\n\\nBobby and I came here after dinner and sat up at the bar. Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.\",\n",
       " u'I rather like Bar Louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie.  Been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  Note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.\\n\\nThe two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.\\n\\nI would highly recommend the Bruschetta Pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone).',\n",
       " u'Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.',\n",
       " u'I don\\'t frequent Bar Louie, and I really don\\'t plan to change that any time soon. I\\'ve eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven\\'t been super impressed by the place.\\n\\nThe food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \"wowed\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don\\'t qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there\\'s cheaper places to get drinks in the area.\\n\\nStill, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they\\'re just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.\\n\\nSo while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don\\'t expect to be back in any time soon.',\n",
       " u'My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \"burger\" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well. \\nMy burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I\\'ve ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I\\'ve ever had?  Yes. It\\'s kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son\\'s burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don\\'t mind a little pink. \\nI love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!!\\nOur server was great and we\\'ll definitely be back.',\n",
       " u'Great environment at night! Songs going on very lively!! The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads',\n",
       " u'Great atmosphere and rather humble, especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, even if they are busy. I enjoy taking clients out for drinks there because of the enjoyable bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. \\n\\nBe sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too!',\n",
       " u\"It's what I expected. Cooler then a Fridays and the food was about the same. It was clean and out waiter was really cool. It was so slow he even took a seat with us and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so. I had the bar Louie burger for my meal and it was good. Nothing outstanding but again what I expected. My group ordered the avocado fries and meatball appetizers. The avocado fries were good but we had to add salt. The meat balls with the small slices of garlic bread was fun to share and yummy.\\n\\nWe went on a slow Sunday night. It was clean and the food came out on time. Again I rate a places on what I expect it to be and what it try's to be not what I think it should be. So just a different kind of Fridays. Also great music playlist.\",\n",
       " u'My boyfriend and I dined at Bar Louie at the Waterfront about a month ago; it was my first time eating there and I was pretty impressed!\\n\\nWe got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come, not to mention delicious!\\n\\nI ordered pasta (I cannot remember the name) but I asked for no artichokes in it. It turned out the artichokes were pre-mixed in the recipe, but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me! I was extremely grateful and impressed.\\n\\nEverything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great. My only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself, because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat. The food and service certainly made up for it though!',\n",
       " u'Best place for a late dinner. They have a pretty diverse and interesting  menu. Kitchen is open til 2am. The atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant.',\n",
       " u'I went this evening. The chop chop salad was awesome. The shrimp tempora was too bready. The bartenders were awful.',\n",
       " u'Dollar beers on Wednesday Night and Loaded Tater Tots, pretty much two solid reasons to visit.  Matter of fact, they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drinks or both!\\n\\nLocated across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date.  I say skip over priced Burgatory and come here on Tuesday for dollar burgers.  Just as good and half the bill.',\n",
       " u'Food was 7 out of 10 for this type of bar / restaurant. Service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor. Untrained and understaffed bartenders will keep me from coming back. No reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar.',\n",
       " u\"Good drink (new old fashioned)Food was so so (shrimp tempura app), but service was NOT good and I think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen. Food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer - approx. 20 mins. with zero acknowledgment from my bartender.  Shrimp were cooked well, but sauces were extremely salty & sweet to be paired with tempura batter.  The bar is drafty and customers other than me were complaining with no noticeable change. I'm not staying for a main course\",\n",
       " u\"I wanna love Bar Louie, I do. It seems like even on the deadest of nights it takes 20 minutes or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from us. The food is good, but the past 3 or 4 times I've come they've been out of tater tots by 9 PM, and I'm always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides it's now time to tell the wait staff they're out of something. It may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"Well it's 9pm on a Tuesday and no tater tots. Dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature. Not very happy. Will try the station square bar Louie next time.\",\n",
       " u\"I absolutely love the ambiance of this place. The bar area is very large, and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couches and whatnot. A solid beer selection at reasonable prices makes you want to come back! It doesn't generally get very crowded (even on Friday and Saturday nights), so don't expect a South Side type of environment. \\n\\nAll that being said, there is a reason why this is a two-star review. Even though this place doesn't get crowded, it takes a very long time to get served. I have waited up to 30 minutes between rounds while sitting at a relatively empty bar.\",\n",
       " u\"I only go here when I can't get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.  Overall I'm pretty underwhelmed by this place.\",\n",
       " u\"My friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner. Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table. He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over. We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn't get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part. We weren't the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset. I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day.\",\n",
       " u'Sign stated \"Seat Yourself\" so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in.  We originally sat upstairs, which was open per the sign.  After 20 minutes we got up and went outside. After 20 minutes outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to us, we said screw it and walked.  The one other time that I had been there the service was so-so.  I will never go back.  Why should I have to try to track people down to pay for a meal?!?',\n",
       " u'Should have checked the reviews before we went. I\\'ve been to \"real\" Bar Louie\\'s in other cities. This is not one of them. Was seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order. Several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on. Awkward. Then someone came over with two plates of food trying to serve us. We thought, here was our big chance to get served, but no, she just walked away. So we left. There are so many restaurants where you can get burgers, just go someplace else.',\n",
       " u'Was there for Saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seats opened.  We sat down right away.  You sat yourself and menu was at the table.   Very casual place, yet family place.   A little noisy so not for date nights.  A little bit sports bar like but not like Champs.  Food was great.  Had boneless chicken nuggets (el fuego).  Side salad was very good.  I had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewers with shrimp fried rice - I had some and it was delicious.  Clean bathroom- very important.',\n",
       " u'I just walked into Bar Louie while we wait for our table at Burgatory. We sat down at the bar and one bartender half acknowledged us and said he would \"be with us in a minute\". We continued to sit there and wait. While she talked to other employees and walked around the bar to talk to the servers. The only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar. When she finally did make her way to our end she greeted the people who just sat down and ignored us who had been sitting there for 7 minutes. This was NOT a busy time and therefore has no excuse for us having to wait more than 2 minutes for a drink. We got up and walked out and will never be back. I have never had a good experience with Bar Louie no matter where it has been. Their customer service is always subpar. Awful.',\n",
       " u'Great place for late dinner after work. Kitchen stays open late. Real good food. Full bar and real good service. Great location.',\n",
       " u\"Came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a Friday evening.  They have some great happy hour deals - $3 drafts (with a nice selection) and half off flat bread pizza. I believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from.  \\n\\nMy friend and I sat at the bar and I have to say the service was just ok.  We weren't given plates or silverware with our pizza, the servers didn't seem to know what the other was doing, and it was a bit haphazard.  I ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare I could have milked the cow.  However, the tatertots served with it were delicious.\\n\\nLocated at the Waterfront across from the movie theater Bar Louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you don't want to wait around at the other restaurants (Burgatory is directly across from it!).  \\n\\nThis will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice.\",\n",
       " u\"I've had a pretty wide variety of experiences at Bar Louie.  Sometimes I go and the service is decent and the drinks are good, and sometimes I go and the service is really slow and the drinks are flat or just plain bad.  The one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food.  Any food that I have ordered has always been pretty good.  I've never had an amazing experience here, but I do still go back for food and drink specials and because of its location near the movie theater.\",\n",
       " u\"I love Bar Louie's happy hour. $5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread? Sign me up!  They also have a few other apps that  are part of the happy hour, but the flatbread is the one I usually get. \\n\\nThe melon martini is my current favorite, but most that I've tried have been good.\\n\\nI don't recommend the shrimp appetizer. And I'm not sure about some of the other food, but happy hour is 5/5 stars. The rest of the time, Bar Louie is probably a 3 star place. \\n\\nSo, if you're in the waterfront and are thinking of Bar Louie, go for the happy hour!\",\n",
       " u'Worst bar I have ever been to. They used maybe no alchohol in their drinks and consistency had no meaning here. We ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly. I posted a picture, you judge.',\n",
       " u'I went with some work friends before catching a movie later that night.  We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.  \\n\\nThe place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance.',\n",
       " u'The worst bar and the worst service in the area. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is not one positive thing I could say about any times Ive ever been here. It has now been added to my very short list of places I will never step foot in again. Please... Take your hard earned money elsewhere.',\n",
       " u\"My boyfriend and I came for $1 burger night and the food was delicious! I am not a huge bread fan; I usually eat my sandwiches open faced but I loved the buns. My boyfriend ordered a $1chicken and a $1burger  and got both chicken. That wouldn't be a big deal if the service made up for mistakes. We love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible. This review is not based on a one night experience. Out of three different times we have experienced bad service- very inattentive. Managers need to review the importance of service with their staff.  If some one likes you and you are attentive to their needs, they are less likely to complain! Bit when you are ignored and they make mistakes, most make it a point to bring it to a managers attention!\",\n",
       " u'The place where my fianc\\xe9 and I first met. Went back for anniversary, mentioned it to server, and were given a free dessert to help us celebrate. Very, very cool Bar Louie! Love ya even more now! \\n\\nJerk shrimp lettuce wraps are so spicy hot they blew us away - extremely spicy - very good but caused us to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat. \\nBuffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot too',\n",
       " u\"Sat at the bar at about 240 Saturday for appetizers and drinks. Not super busy but took over ten minutes for a draft beer and martini. Took 20 for appetizers. No offer to refill drinks or for water. Bartender was organizing glasses or drying glasses...passed us a couple times no eye contact despite empty glasses pushed forward. Others at the bar were also sitting with no drinks, no order taken, and I stress it was not full and the bartender was not busy making drinks. This is the second time this has happened at this location during the day when it's NOT busy. We will stick with Rock Bottom if we are at Waterfront during the day.\",\n",
       " u\"I enjoyed this place. I have avoided this location for so long. I gave it a shot tonight because of a work get together. Our servers name was Sarah and she was great! She was attentive and on her game. I had the 'Diva' martini, which was very sweet and fruity. The bruschetta was good as well (however not traditional), served with a mix of tomato, onion, lettuce. The soft  pretzel sticks were your typical pretzel stick, however good, and served with three dipping sauces, honey mustard, a cheese dip, and a brown sugar/butter dip. The chips and salsa were served with three salsas, guac, regular salsa with a kick, and the cheese dip. The bar is clean. The food is trustworthy and not half bad, it is noisy, but that's is to be expected. It is a great place to watch a game, hang with friends and let go of work. The location is prime as well. Overall, a very pleasant surprise.\",\n",
       " u\"I made a reservation for 6 on a Saturday night. When we arrived we were told by one of the waitresses that they didn't make reservations for less than six.Then she changed that to six or less.  I asked to speak with a manager who told me they don't make reservations for less than ten.  They had no record of my reservation.  The manager was rude.  She asked if I had called the right location.  When I confirmed that I had, it was apparent she didn't believe me.  When I told her I had made the reservation about 10 days earlier during a weekday afternoon and had spoken to a gentleman, she told me they only had one male manager and he said he did not make the reservation.  I was told she could try and find something for us, but there was no way to tell how long that would take since it was a Saturday night.  We didn't stay to find out and have no interest in ever experiencing their brand of customer service again!\",\n",
       " u\"Our adventure to the water front landed us here after our dinner at rock bottom! We just came in here for a post dinner beer! I cannot really comment on anything except the quick bar service! We went up to the bar and ordered our beers! Nothing to complicated! \\n\\nIt was such a nice night out that we sat outside in front of the fire they had going! The fire pits were located in each of the bar tables! I thought it was pretty cool how they set that up! We weren't here very long! \\n\\nWould we visit this place again? Who knows but it helped us kill sometime before we had to go to sing sing\",\n",
       " u\"The food was ok. We ordered the pot pie soup but instead were given the tortilla. We didn't mind too much but the soup was way too spicy for me, and I usually like spicy food. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was decent. Nothing to rave about. It was just ordinary. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and bleu cheese flatbread, and I really liked it. I'd suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat. I also tried their Pinot Grigio, but it was in a very dirty glass.\\n\\nService was ok as well. It wasn't really busy, but it was steady. When we walked in no one was around the door and there were dirty tables everywhere. So we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table. It seems like the waitresses won't clean the tables until after new customers sit down. After a few minutes, I noticed a table of two that were beside us. They were there before us but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drinks and ordered. All in all, this place just needs a bit of organization.\",\n",
       " u\"Valentine's Day! Terrible service. Waitress wasn't attentive at all which would be understandable if it were extremely busy but it was just steady. Food is overpriced for portions.  Small flies flying around restaurant. I investigated myself to see where from and found fly eggs hatching from dirty toilet paper on the floor in the men's room near the corner by the plunger. Mortified by this, my wife and I quickly finished and left. I'll never visit again.\",\n",
       " u\"I go here often because I work down in the waterfront, the staff is very friendly and nice. The drinks are very expensive but that's every Bar Louie. The one in homestead takes forever for food, the wait is ridiculous. I spent almost 45 minutes for some nachos. It's cool for a pre game and they have dollar burgers on Tuesday, and dollar brews on Wednesdays. It's very close to the movie theater so good for a date night! But just make sure you give yourself a little time because the service is a bit bad.\",\n",
       " u\"Surprisingly good fried chicken sandwich (with decent tater tots) and great Happy Hour beverage prices on a Wednesday night including $3.25 drafts, some domestics were $1. \\n\\nConsidering it was a 70+ degree day in March, they were slammed and severely understaffed. No one was bussing tables except the waitresses, and they weren't very attentive to tables, which led to some angry customers around us.\\n\\nStill a worthwhile Happy Hour to check out:\",\n",
       " u\"A nice little quiet restaurant to come in for lunch. I'm a little biased since in college my friends and I would come here for dollar burger night every Tuesday and that was the highlight of my shitty week. But I still recommend this place, always a fun time.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a Bar Louie and it's in one of the most touristy/family-friendly parts of town, so it's not ever going to be an extremely highly rated experience for me personally. I went here with my boyfriend for a friend's birthday a few weeks back however, and I can say that this location (as opposed to the nasty one in Station Square) is pretty okay. The restaurant is spacious inside with plenty of potential to expand outdoors during the warmer months. We had excellent table service from a very nice server who did a good job keeping everyone's drinks full. It was dollar beer night, but all of the options on special were unfortunately not palatable if you like good beer. I would be much more inclined to come back for a beer night if BL rotated one (just one!) nice craft option in with the others. Plenty of people will still choose the piss of course, but ones like me would be so happy. The free chips and dip appetizer I ordered was great at least, particularly the guacamole. If I ever was in the area I would come back and get that again and possibly a drinkable beer during happy hour, since those prices looked good.\",\n",
       " u\"One dolla holla! Such excitement yet such epic failure when the Tuesday $1 custom burgers showed up naked as all get-out. One can't really complain for a $1. But, when Betty barkeep remediated the situ and fetched all of the toppings initially ordered, the burger and portabella were worth the wait. And gimme some more o' dem tots yo! Straight up addictive with salt + pepper and a hint o' lime. Bar Louis is showing its age, but it has been an anchor at the ever-changing Waterfront.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been to Bar Louie several times and I don't have much to say about the food other than is it average and pretty boring bar food. The one thing different is the option for tater tots which people seem to enjoy. Service is fine and prices average. My most favorite thing from Bar Louie is without a doubt, the Berry Mojito! I want one now they are so good! Made with fresh berries and mint! I must get one every time! You will not be disappointed if you like mojitos! I think they are $10 which some might think is expensive but they are just so good! Good wise, I still haven't had anything I really like and I'd rather just come here for drinks.\",\n",
       " u\"Bar Louie is my go to place in the Waterfront.  Consistently good food and friendly talkative wait and bar staff. Lots of wonderful specials but nothing tops Tuesday, dollar burger night, a Bar Louie tradition.  \\nEspecially nice in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open and upper loft patio is full.  Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night.\\nThe food is an eclectic mix.  Burgers are great as are the tots, get them loaded or better yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, salads are great!  Appetizers are all excellent.  Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  My favorite, especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  If you give a green light to the cook, he'll spice it up to en fuego,  the way it's meant to be eaten. \\nEndless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  This is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by.\\nLove places that keep eating out fun.  This is a place where they remember your name!  Recommend strongly!!\",\n",
       " u\"What a delightful experience for this chain establishment. \\nWe were in search of a place to dine outside on this perfect summer Friday evening. The sign said seat yourself and on 1st pass the only tables available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverages. This wasn't on this gals preferred list. We attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min was an even I don't think so.... Back at  Bar Louie we went and scored a recently vacated table. \\nMaria our awesome waitress greeted us kindly but have us some bad news... They were training new kitchen staff and it was taking a bit longer than usual for orders to come out.. But she assured us once they did they were as yummy and up to Bar Louie standards people have come to expect. \\nOkay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance. \\nWe ordered drinks and the food came out quicker than expected. \\nI ordered the  Chop Chop salad and added shrimp to mine... Was done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast was a welcome addition. \\nMy husband  opted for the savory Mac n cheese pork sandwich....my taste bite was scrumptious and lived up to maria's hype. \\nGreat food... Superb service... Great to see a chat in restaurant can still offer patrons something to come back for!\",\n",
       " u'Literally the only place to stop in waterfront. Best happy hour!! Martini and drafts half off? Our server Kayla was phenomenal.',\n",
       " u'Food was good. Waitress was Kayla and she was excellent. It was busy but she handled it and gave our table undivided attention. Thanks Kayla.',\n",
       " u\"Insanely sticky floors, frozen food that's reheated in a microwave and $10 drinks that tastes like sugar water. Skip this place if you don't want to feel ill after dining.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo, we donned our swimsuits and came here.  The main part of the park is closed in the evenings, but the Sandbar and the Sandbar Pool and the Hot Tub remain open for the 21 and over set.  The Sandbar has a great menu of food and drinks and has a $6.00 cover charge to get in.  Occasionally there's live entertainment.\\n\\nIt's hard to believe that before they built this place, it was the site of an abandoned steel mill.  Actually, it was the railroad yard for the nearby Homestead Works.  But after site-clearing and clean-up, they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening.  The view across the Mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side.  There's even a boat dock, so you can arrive by river if you desire.\\n\\nI'm glad I renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully, I'll get another chance to come back.\",\n",
       " u'The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don\\'t think I got the passes worth. \\n\\nThe waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.\\n\\n1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. \\n\\nNext remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I\\'m not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. \\n\\nIf you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won\\'t use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \"I\\'m an adult and you need to have some respect.\" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!\\n\\nSandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don\\'t even care that I\\'m getting splashed all the time I do realize that I\\'m at a pool but it\\'s hard to relax.\\n\\nIf you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you\\'re trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I\\'m looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.',\n",
       " u\"It's fun, but not as fun as Kennywood. The boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that makes for a lot of shoes on/shoes off events. The lazy river could be much better. I did like the water slides and the Potato Patch fries, as well as the scenic location.\",\n",
       " u\"How many times do you get to fall at 70mph, wearing only shorts? Sandcastle can make it happen.\\n\\nIf you're going, it's best to stop by Giant Eagle and grab you some discount tickets from the customer service desk.  $25 is still a bit much in my opinion, but it's better than spending the full $30.99.\\n\\nThere isn't much I can think of that's in Sandcastle that isn't a great time, except maybe walking around and scorching your feet on the boardwalk.  I personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slides, and of course the massive speed slide.  If you're looking for a more relaxed ride, check out the Lazy River, or screw around in the big pool.  There's also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.\\n\\nThere's also plenty of stuff for kids to do... But I don't have kids, so I don't know how all that is.\\n\\nThey do close at 7PM, which is a bit early, so be warned: you definitely want to show up earlier in the day.  BUT it's definitely a good idea to close the park if you can: right toward the end, the lines disappear, and you can ride over and over.  Win!\",\n",
       " u'Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand, there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young \"riders\", on the other hand, Sandcastle, like any city amusement park, attracts more than its fair share of highschool kids looking to spend some time away from their parents and assert their personhood.  \\n\\nUnfortunately that element doesn\\'t particularly care about \"censoring\" speech for 9 year old ears, and worse, in the Mon Tsunami, about personal space, since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and \\'showing off\\' for the fairer sex, and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.\\n\\nHaving said that, it\\'s still a good day at the park. . . cheese fries, a cool dip in the pool on a hot day, some fun slides. . . \\n\\nI think in rating Sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park.  It is NOT policed particularly effectively.  if you take small children you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings, paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity, \"accidentally\" bumping into people for a reaction from their group.  \\n\\nMOSTLY it\\'s a good time.  Mostly.',\n",
       " u\"So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway, it was in California at Raging Rivers and it was a traumatizing experience. Screaming & being tossed around in the pool that pushes periodic waves at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knees and feet. Not fun.\\n\\nSo to say the least, I was a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling I was being drowned. Luckily that did not happen.\\n\\nI seriously had SO MUCH fun here! I honestly was only expecting to go on the Lazy River pool all day but with my bf, we hit up so many rides... tandem AND single rides! I feel like such a big girl now! Definitely lean back while you're on those single donuts on the water rides, or else you feel like you're going to flip over while swishing down the tubes. The new dragon ride they just opened up was okay. I was expecting it to be so much more fun, but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that was it. \\n\\nThere was this one ride where you slide down the tubes for a few seconds, then you land into a pool where a worker pushes you into another tube and this continues about 3 times. It was weird. Kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through. Although it was still fun. The last dude threw me in backwards! Scared the crap out of me but it was fun :)\\n\\nThe food here is surprisingly pretty affordable. Plus, who wants to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit. Me don't want no pot belly. \\n\\nOverall I had such a fun time here. It definitely made me rethink my fear of water parks. By the way, we went on a Saturday in early June and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be! So the lines weren't long at all. Also, go to Giant Eagle to purchase your discounted tickets. You save a few bucks versus buying them at the water park. Oh and don't forget to bring sandals while walking around. Your feet will literally feel like they're burning from the ground. Now go off and have some fun! :)\",\n",
