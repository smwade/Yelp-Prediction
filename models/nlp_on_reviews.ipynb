      "I ordered my bed on 8/31 during the Labor Day Sale.  The people at the Chandler store were very nice.  They said that the bed would take 2-3 weeks for delivery.  I received confirmation that my bed would be delivered on Tuesday 9/23 sometime between 2pm and 5pm.  This required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed.  At 4:15, I received a call saying that something came up and my bed would not be delivered.  After several phone calls, I still could get no answer why my bed wasn't going to be delivered, nor could I get an answer on when it would be delivered.  I assumed that I would be a higher priority since they missed their original delivery date, but I was wrong.  They said the Regional Coordinator will be personally giving me a call to schedule a new date.  Today is Saturday 9/27 and I have not heard from anyone.  I called and spoke with a representative and she got me scheduled for Wednesday 10/1, one full month later!  I will have to take another day off just to receive this bed.  This whole process has been a huge inconvenience and the people at Sleep Number have been very disrespectful.  I don't doubt that the bed is a good product; however, due to the inconvenience with the delivery process, I would not recommend anyone purchase a Sleep Number bed unless you have several vacation days available just to receive the delivery.  The only thing Sleep Number has done for me to compensate for the inconvenience was waive the $180 delivery fee.  Keep in mind I paid $3700 for the bed and took 2 days off from work.  I feel like I am not a very valued customer.  Basically, they are saying, \"Go pound sand\" and we'll get the bed to you whenever we feel like it.\n",

      "Went to check out the mattresses at the store today before heading off to work. My employer has a great network of complanies offering discounts so thought maybe I could get with 2016 and get a new mattress! Not sure if ready to buy but wanted to explore the product! Met at door by the nicest employee EVER by the name of \"Roo\" Being in my 50's...and kinda old school...wasnt sure I was even going to like the new \"technology\" of a sleep number mattress. I have to admit I was VERY IMPRESSED by the way my back felt on this mattress! I am \"bottom heavy\" :) admittedly and suffer from lower back pain and was truly amazed at the difference an adjustable mattress can make you feel. I do say it was a weird experience watching my \"body\" on the screen above and how it dug into the bed...then relaxed into it! Roo was excellent in explaining how the mattress conformed...the tehnology involved and the benefits of such a mattress! The store was \"white-glove\" clean and the atmosphere felt warm and inviting! \n",
      "    Was asked my preference of pillow (I am a soft!) and happy I didn't have to take off my shoes when lying on the bed! Roo kept a friendly and cheerful conversation the entire time and made me feel comfortable in what I thought may be an uncomfortable situation. The remotes were a nice touch...multi settings for EACH SIDE of bed...and even a pillow top version for us \"princesses!!\" \n",
      "    If you are thinking of getting a new mattress and are \"OLD SCHOOL\" like myself you really should try this place! If I didnt love my mattress soooo much and wasn't stuck in the 80's I would have walked with a new mattrress today...who knows .. maybe tomorrow!! Just letting my yelper friends know this product rocks and so do the employees here! Tell them Deb sent you...okay, maybe not because I can guarantee they have NO CLUE who I am!!  LOL!! :) Thanks to all of you for all your great (and bad) reviews...always YELP before I buy!! FYI...FORGET TO SAY.... I am a \"35\" !! :)\n",

      "OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few \"adult\" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying \"who ordered pizza\" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called \"their customer service\" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm....

A group of us went together to have breakfast in downtown Phoenix on Saturday, we entered the garage and there was a line of cars waiting to go because the gate to let you in was broken! Of course there wasn't any employees to be found and the only way to get out was to back up, on a slant, around a blind corner, not an easy task even for the brand new vehicle we were in! It's a good thing it doesn't often snow here or we would never have made it out! Although the incident restored my faith that there are still good people out there who are willing to help.

      "This is a pretty good employment agency that does a nice job of placing people in positions.  Though they do some administrative/clerical placements, this branch in particular specializes more in labor/warehouse jobs so if you're looking for office/clerical work I'd advise you to look elsewhere. They do have a Tempe office that specializes in clerical placements but I had a bad experience with them over the phone that went like this:  I was registered at the 3rd street branch before realizing they specialize in labor jobs.  I was told by staff member Janet that I could just call the Tempe office and ask them to look for jobs for me.  I made a call to them one day and a woman named Veronica (who discovered later is not very nice or professional) answered the phone.  I told her I am a current employee and my record is at the Phoenix branch but would appreciate it if they would consider me for office positions since that's my area of specialty.  After that there was a brief pause and the sound of the phone hanging up.  That is no way to conduct business and also makes me wonder why the Phoenix branch couldn't just share my information with the Tempe branch.  For goodness sakes, if I'm already an employee why then do I need to do the work for them. I mean isn't that part of what staffing consultants do?  Administering evaluations, placing candidates and contacting other branches about current candidates?  That experience lead me to believe that the Solutions Staffing offices here in AZ do a  poor job of communicating with one another or there is some type of competitive issue or bad blood running between the different branches or just certain ones.  But anyway, the staff at this location however is friendly and most of them are bilingual so it is a good place to go for those that speak English a second language that are looking for labor jobs.  As of this posting, there is no need to schedule an appointment as walk-ins are welcomed to come in Monday through Friday at 9am and at 1pm only.  Parking is relatively easy to find and the offices are clean and inviting.  As with any agency, bring two forms of ID, try to have a current copy of your resume ready (this agency welcomes it but is not required) and be prepared to stay at least 2 hours to fill out paperwork, be interviewed and take any skills evaluations that may be administered.  Good luck!\n",
